1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Nothing to be done.

2
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:07,743
I'm beginning to come round to
that opinion.

3
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:10,473
All my life I've tried to put it
from me,..

4
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,141
saying Vladimir, be reasonable,

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,750
you haven't yet tried everything.

6
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:16,345
And I resumed the struggle.

7
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,010
So there you are again.

8
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,840
Am I?

9
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:23,416
I'm glad to see you back.
I thought you were gone forever.

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,010
Me too.

11
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,756
Together again at last!

12
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,516
We'll have to celebrate this.

13
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,134
But how?

14
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,734
Get up till I embrace you.

15
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,321
Not now, not now.

16
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,872
May one inquire where His Highness
spent the night?

17
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:36,652
In a ditch.

18
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,058
A ditch! Where?

19
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,814
And they didn't beat you?

20
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:38,732
Over there.

21
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:40,427
Beat me?

22
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:41,726
Certainly they beat me.

23
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:42,816
The same lot as usual?

24
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,055
The same? I don't know.

25
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:45,222
When I think of it… all these years

26
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,064
but for me… where would you be

27
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:48,033
You'd be nothing more than
a little heap of

28
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,885
bones at the present minute,
no doubt about it.

29
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:51,227
And what of it?

30
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,785
It's too much for one man.

31
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,865
On the other hand what's the good of
losing heart now, that's what I say.

32
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,206
We should have thought of it a million
years ago, when the world is young.

33
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:03,039
Ah stop blathering and help me off
with this bloody thing.

34
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:07,984
Hand in hand from the top of
the Eiffel Tower,among the first.

35
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,811
We were respectable in those days.

36
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:13,562
Now it's too late.
They wouldn't even let us up.

37
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:15,094
What are you doing?

38
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,102
Taking off my boot.

39
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,803
Did that never happen to you?

40
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:20,831
Boots must be taken off every day,

41
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:22,612
I'm tired telling you that.
Why don't you listen to me?

42
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:23,355
- Help me!
- It hurts?

43
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:25,549
Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!

44
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,156
No one ever suffers but you.

45
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,102
I don't count.

46
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:30,586
I'd like to hear what you'd say
if you had what I have.

47
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:31,092
It hurts?

48
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,015
Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!

49
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,883
You might button it all the same.

50
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:38,283
True.

51
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:42,003
Never neglect the little things
of life.

52
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,893
What do you expect,

53
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,039
you always wait till the last moment.

54
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,295
The last moment...

55
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:52,837
Hope deferred maketh the something
sick.

56
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:53,498
Who said that?

57
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:55,042
Why don't you help me?

58
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,541
Sometimes I feel it coming all the same.

59
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:01,083
Then I go all queer.

60
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,212
How shall I say?

61
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,446
Relieved and at the same time...

62
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,195
appalled.

63
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,195
AP-PALLED.

64
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,185
Funny.

65
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,285
Nothing to be done.

66
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,085
Well?

67
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,028
Nothing.

68
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:25,804
Show me.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,860
There's nothing to show.

70
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:27,809
Try and put it on again.

71
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,526
I'll air it for a bit.

72
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:31,084
There's man all over for you,

73
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,241
blaming on his boots the faults
of his feet.

74
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:44,349
This is getting alarming.

75
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,538
One of the thieves was saved.

76
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,037
It's a reasonable percentage.

77
00:03:59,237 --> 00:03:59,837
Gogo!

78
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:00,495
What?

79
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,550
Suppose we repented.

80
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,588
Repented what?

81
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,006
Oh… We wouldn't have to go into
the details.

82
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,044
Our being born?

83
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,850
One daren't even laugh any more.

84
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:10,462
Dreadful privation.

85
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:12,457
Merely smile.

86
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:15,857
It's not the same thing.

87
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,257
Nothing to be done.

88
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:19,657
Gogo!

89
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:20,784
What is it?

90
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,289
Did you ever read the Bible?

91
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:23,533
The Bible . . .

92
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,733
I must have taken a look at it.

93
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,008
Do you remember the Gospels?

94
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:31,278
I remember the maps of the Holy Land.
Coloured they were. Very pretty.

95
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:37,278
The Dead Sea was pale blue.
The very look of it made me thirsty.

96
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:41,278
That's where we'll go, I used to say,
that's where we'll go for our honeymoon.

97
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:43,263
We'll swim. We'll be happy.

98
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:44,563
You should have been a poet.

99
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:48,894
I was. Isn't that obvious?

100
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,367
Where was I...

101
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:52,167
How's your foot?

102
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:53,462
Swelling visibly.

103
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,106
Ah yes, the two thieves. Do you
remember the story?

104
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:55,886
No.

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,830
- Shall I tell it to you?
- No.

106
00:04:56,907 --> 00:05:00,427
It'll pass the time. Two thieves,
crucified at the same time as our Saviour. One?

107
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:01,889
Our what?

108
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,585
Our Saviour. Two thieves.

109
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,185
One is supposed to have been saved
and the other...

110
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:07,585
damned.

111
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,508
Saved from what?

112
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:09,681
Hell. I'm going.

113
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,077
And yet...how is it –this is not
boring you I hope

114
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:15,277
how is it that of the four Evangelists
only one speaks of a thief being saved.

115
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:21,077
The four of them were there –or thereabouts–
and only one speaks of a thief being saved.

116
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,077
Come on, Gogo, return the ball,
can't you, once in a while?

117
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:29,077
I find this really most extraordinarily
interesting.

118
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:33,182
One out of four. Of the other three,
two don't mention any thieves at all

119
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:34,852
and the third says that both of
them abused him.

120
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:35,482
Who?

121
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:36,282
What?

122
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,282
What's all this about? Abused who?

123
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,282
- The Saviour.
- Why?

124
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,482
- Because he wouldn't save them.
- From hell?

125
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,082
- Imbecile! From death.
- Well what of it?

126
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:42,082
Then the two of them must have
been damned.

127
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:42,802
And why not?

128
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,082
But one of the four says that
one of the two was saved.

129
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:47,082
They don't agree and that's
all there is to it.

130
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:49,482
But all four were there. And only one
speaks of a thief being saved.

131
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,882
Why believe him rather than
the others?

132
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:52,182
Who believes him?

133
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,182
Everybody.

134
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,182
It's the only version they know.

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,200
People are bloody ignorant apes.

136
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,400
Pah!

137
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,200
Charming spot.

138
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,500
Inspiring prospects.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's go.

140
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
- We can't.
- Why not?

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
We're waiting for Godot.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ah! Yes.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,100
You're sure it was here?

144
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

145
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
That we were to wait.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He said by the tree.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you see any others?

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
What is it?

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't know. A willow.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are the leaves?

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It must be dead.

152
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,600
No more weeping.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or perhaps it's not the season.

154
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Looks to me more like a bush.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
- A shrub.
- A bush.

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
What are you insinuating?
That we've come to the wrong place?

157
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,500
He should be here.

158
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
He didn't say for sure he'd come.

159
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,300
- And if he doesn't come?
- We'll come back tomorrow.

160
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
And then the day after tomorrow.

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
- Possibly.
- And so on.

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
- The point is?
- Until he comes.

163
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
You're merciless.

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
We came here yesterday.

165
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Ah no, there you're mistaken.

166
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
What did we do yesterday?

167
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,300
What did we do yesterday?

168
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Yes.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why...

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,500
Nothing is certain when you're about.

171
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
In my opinion we were here.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
You recognize the place?

173
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I didn't say that.

174
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Well?

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That makes no difference.

176
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
All the same...

177
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
...that tree...

178
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
...that stone...

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
...that bog...

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,900
You're sure it was this evening?

181
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
What?

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,100
That we were to wait.

183
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
He said Saturday.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,900
I think.

185
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,500
You think.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I must have made a note of it.

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But what Saturday? And is it Saturday?

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is it not rather Sunday? Or Monday?
Or Friday?

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's not possible!

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Or Thursday?

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What'll we do?

192
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,350
If he came yesterday and we weren't here
you may be sure he won't come again today.

193
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,500
But you say we were here yesterday.

194
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
I may be mistaken.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's stop talking for a minute,
do you mind?

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right.

197
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Gogo!...

198
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Gogo!...

199
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
GOGO!

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,500
I was asleep! Why will you never
let me sleep?

201
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,700
I felt lonely.

202
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I had a dream.

203
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,500
Don't tell me!

204
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,700
- I dreamt that?
- DON’T

205
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,800
TELL ME!

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,500
This one is enough for you?

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
It's not nice of you, Didi.

208
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,000
Who am I to tell my private nightmares
to if I can't tell them to you?

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Let them remain private.
You know I can't bear that.

210
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
There are times when I wonder
if it wouldn't be better for us to part.

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You wouldn't go far.

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
That would be too bad.

213
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,700
Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad?

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When you think of the beauty
of the way.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And the goodness of the wayfarers.

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wouldn't it, Didi?

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Calm yourself.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Calm...

219
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,000
Calm...

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The English say cawm.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know the story of the Englishman
in the brothel?

222
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,200
- Yes.
- Tell it to me.

223
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,000
Ah stop it!

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,900
An Englishman having drunk a little more
than usual proceeds to a brothel.

225
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,000
The bawd asks him if he wants a fair one,
a dark one or a red-haired one. Go on.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
STOP IT!

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,300
You wanted to speak to me?

228
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
You had something to say to me?

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Didi...

230
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,000
I've nothing to say to you.

231
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,200
You're angry?

232
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Forgive me.

233
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,800
Come, Didi.

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Give me your hand.

235
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,300
Embrace me!

236
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,800
Don't be stubborn!

237
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
You stink of garlic!

238
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,000
It's for the kidneys.

239
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
What do we do now?

240
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Wait.

241
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes, but while waiting.

242
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,500
What about hanging ourselves?

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
It'd give us an erection.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,500
An erection!

245
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
With all that follows.

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where it falls mandrakes grow.

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,200
That's why they shriek when you
pull them up. Did you not know that?

248
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Let's hang ourselves immediately!

249
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,200
From a bough?

250
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I wouldn't trust it.

251
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,700
We can always try.

252
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,800
- Go ahead.
- No, after you.

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,500
No no, you first.

254
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
- Why me?
- You're lighter than I am.

255
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Just so!

256
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't understand.

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Use your intelligence, can't you?

258
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,100
I remain in the dark.

259
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
This is how it is. The bough...

260
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
the bough...

261
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,700
Use your head, can't you?

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
You're my only hope.

263
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Gogo light—bough not break—Gogo dead.

264
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,800
Didi heavy—bough break—Didi alone.
Where as-

265
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,100
I hadn't thought of that.

266
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
If it hangs you it'll hang anything.

267
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
But am I heavier than you?

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know. So you tell me.

269
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,700
There's an even chance.
Or nearly.

270
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Well? What do we do?

271
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,300
Don't let's do anything. It's safer.

272
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Let's wait and see what he says.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
- Who?
- Godot

274
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Ah! Yes.

275
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Let's wait till we know exactly
how we stand.

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,100
On the other hand it might be better
to strike the iron before it freezes.

277
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm curious to hear what he has to offer.
Then we'll take it or leave it.

278
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,700
What exactly did we ask him for?

279
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Were you not there?

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't have been listening.

281
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh... Nothing very definite.

282
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
A kind of prayer.

283
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
- Precisely.
- A vague supplication.

284
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,600
Exactly.

285
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,300
- And what did he reply?
- That he'd see.

286
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
That he couldn't promise anything.

287
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
That he'd have to think it over.

288
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,500
- In the quiet of his home.
- Consult his family.

289
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
- His friends.
- His agents.

290
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
- His correspondents.
- His books.

291
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
His bank account.

292
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Before taking a decision.

293
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
- It's the normal thing.
- Is it not?

294
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
- I think it is.
- I think so too.

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And we?

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,500
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, And we?

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't understand.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,500
- Where do we come in?
- Come in?

299
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,400
Take your time.

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Come in?

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,500
On our hands and knees.

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
As bad as that?

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Your Worship wishes to assert
his prerogatives?

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
We've no rights any more?

305
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,000
You'd make me laugh if it wasn't
prohibited.

306
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
We've lost our rights?

307
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
We got rid of them.

308
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,000
We're not tied?

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We're not?

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Listen!

311
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
I hear nothing.

312
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Nor I.

313
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
-You gave me a fright.
-I thought it was he.

314
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,800
Who?

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Godot.

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The wind in the reeds.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I could have sworn I heard shouts.

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And why would he shout?

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
At his horse.

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let’s go.

321
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Where?

322
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
Perhaps, we slept tonight his loft
all snug and dry.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
Your belly is for in the high,
that’s what waiting for. No?

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,100
Not all night.

325
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,000
It’s still day.

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm hungry!

327
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Do you want a carrot?

328
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
Is that all there is?

329
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I might have some turnips.

330
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Give me a carrot.

331
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's a turnip!

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh pardon! I could have sworn
it was a carrot.

333
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
All that's turnips.

334
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,000
You must have eaten the last.

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Wait, I have it.

336
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,800
There, dear fellow. Give me the
turnip.

337
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,000
Make it last, that's the end of them.

338
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
I asked you a question.

339
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
-Did you reply?
-How's the carrot?

340
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,300
It's a carrot.

341
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,000
So much the better, so much the
better.

342
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,000
Well!. What was it you wanted
to know?

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
I've forgotten.

344
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
That's what annoys me.

345
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll never forget this carrot.

346
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,500
Ah yes, now I remember.

347
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,000
Well?

348
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,241
We're not tied?

349
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,586
I don't hear a word you're saying.

350
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,407
I'm asking you if we're tied.

351
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:50,945
Tied?

352
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,214
Ti-ed.

353
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:53,821
How do you mean tied?

354
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:54,528
Down.

355
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:56,356
But to whom? By whom?

356
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:57,435
To your man.

357
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,645
To Godot? Tied to Godot!
What an idea!

358
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,061
No question of it.

359
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,640
For the moment.

360
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,485
His name is Godot?

361
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:04,843
I think so.

362
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,432
Ah Yes.

363
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,509
Funny, the more you eat the
worse it gets.

364
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,657
With me it's just the opposite.

365
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:14,453
In other words?

366
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,114
I get used to the muck as I go along.

367
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,414
- Is that the opposite?
- Question of temperament.

368
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,201
Of character.

369
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,070
Nothing you can do about it.

370
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:22,472
- No use struggling.
- One is what one is.

371
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,008
No use wriggling.

372
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,659
The essential doesn't change.

373
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:27,571
Nothing to be done.

374
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,353
Do you like to finish it?

375
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,556
On!

376
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,049
Back!

377
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:18,493
Let me go!

378
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,041
Stay where you are!

379
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:19,796
Be careful!

380
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,128
He's wicked.

381
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,224
With strangers.

382
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:24,788
- Is that him?
- Who?

383
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:25,837
- Er...
- Godot?

384
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:26,397
Yes.

385
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,694
I present myself: Pozzo.

386
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:29,586
Not at all!

387
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,370
- He said Godot.
- Not at all!

388
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,426
You're not Mr. Godot, Sir?

389
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:40,652
I am Pozzo!

390
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,854
Does that name mean nothing to you?

391
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,896
I say does that name mean nothing
to you?

392
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,074
- Bozzo... Bozzo...
- Pozzo... Pozzo...

393
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,122
PPPOZZZO!

394
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,929
Ah! Pozzo... let me see... Pozzo...

395
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,015
Is it Pozzo or Bozzo?

396
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,707
Pozzo

397
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,719
no… I'm afraid I… no…I don't seem to

398
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,337
I once knew a family called Gozzo.

399
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:05,447
The mother had the clap.

400
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,574
We're not from these parts, Sir.

401
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,209
You are human beings none the less.

402
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:17,277
As far as one can see. Of the
same species as myself.

403
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,150
Of the same species as Pozzo!

404
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,603
Made in God's image!

405
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,090
Well you see?

406
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,880
- Who is Godot?
- Godot?

407
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:27,477
- You took me for Godot.
- Oh no, Sir,..

408
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,489
...not for an instant, Sir.

409
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:29,221
Who is he?

410
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,951
Oh he's a.. he's a kind of
acquaintance.

411
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:33,004
Nothing of the kind, we hardly
know him.

412
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,286
True... we don't know him very well...
but all the same...

413
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,760
Personally, I wouldn't even know
him if I saw him.

414
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,687
You took me for him.

415
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,786
That's to say... you understand...

416
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,071
the dusk...

417
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:42,986
the strain...

418
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,973
waiting...

419
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,457
I confess... I imagined...
for a second...

420
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,154
Waiting?

421
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:49,844
So you were waiting for him?

422
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,001
- Well you see?
- Here?

423
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:52,732
On my land?

424
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,637
We didn't intend any harm.

425
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:55,457
We meant well.

426
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,620
The road is free to all.

427
00:17:56,996 --> 00:17:58,816
- That's how we looked at it.
- It's a disgrace.

428
00:17:59,269 --> 00:17:59,909
But there you are.

429
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,125
Nothing we can do about it.

430
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:02,566
Let's say no more about it.

431
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,073
Up pig!

432
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,669
Every time he drops he falls asleep.

433
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,210
Up hog!

434
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:31,444
Back!

435
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,841
Stop!

436
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:42,183
Turn!

437
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:48,811
Gentlemen, I am happy to have
met you.

438
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,344
Yes yes, sincerely happy.

439
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,166
Closer!

440
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:58,643
Stop!

441
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,542
Yes, the road seems long when
one journeys all alone for...

442
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:04,836
yes...

443
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,321
yes, six hours, that's right,..

444
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,010
...six hours on end, and never
a soul in sight.

445
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,550
Coat!

446
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:24,174
Hold that!

447
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:34,642
Coat!

448
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:46,933
Touch of autumn in the air this
evening.

449
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,145
Whip!

450
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:53,347
Yes, gentlemen, I cannot go
for long without

451
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,103
the society of my likes...

452
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,657
...even when the likeness

453
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,069
...is an imperfect one.

454
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,358
Stool!

455
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:22,344
Closer!

456
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,850
Back!

457
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,649
Further!

458
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:41,308
Stop!

459
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,362
That is why, with your permission,
I propose to...

460
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,998
...dally with you a moment,
before I venture any further.

461
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,003
Basket!

462
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,380
The fresh air stimulates the
jaded appetite.

463
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,240
Basket!

464
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,411
Further!

465
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,044
He stinks.

466
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,508
Happy days!

467
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:54,262
What ails him?

468
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:55,505
He looks tired.

469
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,371
Why doesn't he put down his bags?

470
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:58,764
How do I know?

471
00:21:59,188 --> 00:21:59,978
Careful!

472
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:01,578
Say something to him.

473
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:03,362
- Look!
- What?

474
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:04,002
His neck!

475
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:05,605
Oh I say!

476
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:07,162
- A running sore!
- It's the rope.

477
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,401
- It's the rubbing.
- It's inevitable.

478
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10,482
- It's the knot.
- It's the chafing.

479
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:11,579
He's not bad looking.

480
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:12,356
Would you say so?

481
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:13,362
A trifle effeminate.

482
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,125
- Look at the slobber.
- It's inevitable.

483
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:17,754
- Look at the slaver.
- Perhaps he's a halfwit.

484
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:18,543
A cretin.

485
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,700
Looks like a goiter.

486
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,979
It's not certain.

487
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,397
- He's panting.
- It's inevitable.

488
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,680
- And his eyes!
- What about them?

489
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:28,915
Goggling out of his head.

490
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,956
Looks like his last gasp to me.

491
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,079
It's not certain. Ask him a question.

492
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,909
- Would that be a good thing?
- What do we risk?

493
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:36,397
Mister...

494
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:37,879
Louder.

495
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:39,153
Mister...

496
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,188
Leave him in peace!

497
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:45,433
Can't you see he wants to rest?

498
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:47,259
Basket!

499
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,504
Basket!

500
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,460
Ah! That's better.

501
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,954
Please Sir...

502
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,730
What is it, my good man?

503
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,680
Er… you've finished with the

504
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,818
you don't need the… er… bones, Sir?

505
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,059
You couldn't have waited?

506
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,465
No no, he does well to ask.

507
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,665
Do I need the bones?

508
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,901
No, personally I do not need them
any more.

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But...

510
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,217
but in theory the bones go to
the carrier.

511
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,165
He is therefore the one to ask.

512
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:58,034
Go on, go on, don't be afraid,
ask him, he'll tell you.

513
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:00,983
Mister...

514
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,111
Excuse me, Mister...

515
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,360
You're being spoken to, pig!
Reply!

516
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:07,156
Try him again.

517
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,211
Excuse me, Mister...

518
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:13,382
the bones, you won't be wanting
the bones?

519
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,277
Mister!

520
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,110
Reply pig! Do you want them or
don't you?

521
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:38,647
They're yours.

522
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:41,834
I don't like it.

523
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,289
I've never known him to refuse
a bone before.

524
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:47,103
Nice business it'd be if he fell sick on me!

525
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,628
It's a scandal!

526
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,089
Are you alluding to anything in
particular?

527
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:52,748
To treat a man… like that

528
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,831
I think that… no

529
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:55,762
a human being

530
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,362
no… it's a scandal!

531
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:58,588
A disgrace!

532
00:24:59,024 --> 00:24:59,994
You are severe.

533
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:03,324
What age are you, if it's not
a rude question?

534
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:05,203
Sixty?

535
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:06,646
Seventy?

536
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,410
What age would you say he was?

537
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:09,573
Eleven.

538
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:11,546
I am impertinent.

539
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:14,253
I must be getting on.

540
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,215
Thank you for your society.

541
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:23,308
Unless I smoke another pipe
before I go.

542
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,105
What do you say?

543
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:28,026
Oh I'm only a small smoker, a very
small smoker,..

544
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,772
...it makes my heart go pit-a-pat.

545
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:34,259
It's the nicotine, one absorbs
it in spite of one's precautions.

546
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,041
You know how it is.

547
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:38,254
But perhaps you don't smoke?

548
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,151
Yes?

549
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,106
No?

550
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:45,748
It's of no importance.

551
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,178
But how am I to sit down,..

552
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,759
now without affectation,..

553
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:55,854
...now that
I have risen?

554
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,340
Without appearing to –how shall
I say?

555
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:00,804
without appearing to falter.

556
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,716
I beg your pardon?

557
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,623
Perhaps you didn't speak?

558
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,082
It's of no importance.

559
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:09,192
Let me see...

560
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,451
Ah! That's better.

561
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,928
- Let's go.
- So soon?

562
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:12,825
One moment!

563
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,880
Stool!

564
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:26,387
More!

565
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
There!

566
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:32,034
Done it!

567
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:33,299
Let's go!

568
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,491
I hope I'm not driving you away.

569
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,384
Wait a little longer, you'll
never regret it.

570
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:37,276
We're in no hurry.

571
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:38,897
The second is never so sweet...

572
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,510
...as the first I mean. But it's
sweet just the same.

573
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:45,602
I'm going.

574
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:48,801
Suppose you go now while it is
still day, for there is no denying...

575
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,323
...it is still day.

576
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:51,802
Good. What happens in that case...

577
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
...to your appointment with this...

578
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Godet...

579
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Godot...

580
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,298
Godin...

581
00:26:57,355 --> 00:27:01,125
Anyhow you see who I mean,
who has your future in his hands...

582
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:02,731
...at least your immediate future?

583
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:03,317
Who told you?

584
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:06,494
He speaks to me again! If this goes on
much longer we'll soon be old friends.

585
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,189
Why doesn't he put down his bags?

586
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:09,734
I too would be happy to meet him.

587
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,041
The more people I meet the happier
I become.

588
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,562
From the meanest creature one
departs wiser, richer,..

589
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,302
...more conscious of one's blessings.
Even you...

590
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,473
who knows, even you, will have
added to my store.

591
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:22,745
Why doesn't he put down his bags?

592
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:23,937
But that would surprise me.

593
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,037
You're being asked a question.

594
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,841
A question! Who? What?

595
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:30,241
A moment ago you were calling me Sir,
in fear and trembling.

596
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:34,286
Now you're asking me questions.
No good will come of this!

597
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,680
- I think he's listening.
- What?

598
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,473
You can ask him now. He's on the
alert.

599
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:38,123
Ask him what?

600
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,679
- Why he doesn't put down his bags.
- I wonder.

601
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:41,654
Ask him, can't you?

602
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:44,914
You want to know why he doesn't
put down his bags, as you call them.

603
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:45,646
That's it.

604
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:46,877
You are sure you agree with that?

605
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,499
He's puffing like a grampus.

606
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,500
The answer is this.

607
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,653
But stay still, I beg of you,
you're making me nervous!

608
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:54,198
Here.

609
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,347
- What is it?
- He's about to speak.

610
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:59,779
Is everybody ready?

611
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:02,808
Is everybody looking at me?

612
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:04,808
Will you look at me, pig!

613
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:06,095
Good.

614
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:09,421
I am ready.

615
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:11,391
Is everybody listening?

616
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:12,291
Hog!

617
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,223
Is everybody ready?

618
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:19,293
I don't like talking in a vacuum.

619
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:22,423
Good.

620
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,195
- Let me see.
- I'm going.

621
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,364
What was it exactly you wanted
to know?

622
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:27,683
- Why he?
- Don't interrupt me!

623
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,120
If we all speak at once we'll
never get anywhere.

624
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,620
What was I saying?

625
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:40,437
What was I saying?

626
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:02,186
Bags.

627
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:04,751
Why?

628
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:07,294
Always hold.

629
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:10,268
Never put down.

630
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Why?

631
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,975
Ah! Why couldn't you say so before?

632
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,379
Why he doesn't make himself comfortable?

633
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,117
Let's try and get this clear.

634
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:22,809
Has he not the right to?

635
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,300
Certainly he has.

636
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:29,386
It follows that he doesn't want to.
There's reasoning for you.

637
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,653
And why doesn't he want to?
Gentlemen, the reason is this.

638
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:33,625
Make a note of this.

639
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,134
He wants to impress me, so that
I'll keep him.

640
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:35,923
What?

641
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,270
Perhaps I haven't got it quite right.

642
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:42,275
He wants to mollify me, so that I'll
give up the idea of parting with him.

643
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:43,951
No, that's not exactly it either.

644
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:45,893
- You want to get rid of him?
- He wants to con me, but he won't.

645
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:46,474
You want to get rid of him?

646
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,899
He imagines that when I see how
well he carries I'll be tempted...

647
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:51,217
- ...to keep him on in that capacity.
- You've had enough of him?

648
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:53,036
In reality he carries like a pig.
It's not his job.

649
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:54,098
You want to get rid of him?

650
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:58,684
He imagines that when I see him
indefatigable I'll regret my decision.

651
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:02,658
Such is his miserable scheme.
As though I were short of slaves!

652
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,337
Atlas, son of Jupiter!

653
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:08,507
Well, that's that, I think.
Anything else?

654
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,565
You want to get rid of him?

655
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,992
Remark that I might just as well
have been in his shoes and he in mine.

656
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:15,635
If chance had not willed otherwise.
To each one his due.

657
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:16,601
You waagerrim?

658
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:18,372
I beg your pardon?

659
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,407
You want to get rid of him?

660
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,179
I do.

661
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,202
But instead of driving him away
as I might have done,..

662
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,189
I mean instead of simply kicking
him out on his arse,..

663
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:32,337
in the goodness of my heart
I am bringing him to the fair,..

664
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,230
where I hope to get a good price
for him.

665
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:40,373
The truth is you can't drive
such creatures away.

666
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:44,492
The best thing would be to kill them.

667
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,559
He's crying!

668
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,270
Old dogs have more dignity.

669
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:58,234
Comfort him,..

670
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:00,544
since you pity him.

671
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:03,495
Come on.

672
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:12,628
Wipe away his tears, he'll feel
less forsaken.

673
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,537
Here, give it to me, I'll do it.

674
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,363
Make haste, before he stops.

675
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:24,137
Oh the swine!

676
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:25,295
Hanky!

677
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,940
He's crippled me!

678
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:28,119
Show me.

679
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:31,152
I told you he didn't like strangers.

680
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:33,418
He's bleeding!

681
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,211
It's a good sign.

682
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:36,969
He's stopped crying.

683
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,247
You have replaced him as it were.

684
00:31:39,894 --> 00:31:41,704
The tears of the world are a
constant quantity.

685
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,568
For each one who begins to weep,
somewhere else another stops.

686
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:46,575
The same is true of the laugh.

687
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:57,118
Let us not then speak ill of
our generation,..

688
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,440
it is not any unhappier than
its predecessors.

689
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,192
Let us not speak well of it either.

690
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,715
Let us not speak of it at all.

691
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,841
It is true

692
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,082
the population has increased.

693
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:16,366
Will night never come?

694
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,835
Guess who taught me all these
beautiful things.

695
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,458
My Lucky!

696
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:24,825
But for him all my thoughts,
all my feelings,..

697
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,814
would have been of common things.

698
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:28,628
Professional worries!

699
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,752
Beauty, grace, truth of the
first water,..

700
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:33,748
I knew they were all beyond me.

701
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:37,335
So I took a knook.

702
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:38,718
A knook?

703
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:40,682
That was nearly sixty years ago...

704
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:46,205
...yes, nearly sixty.

705
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,448
You wouldn't think it to look
at me, would you?

706
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,781
Compared to him I look like
a young man,..

707
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
no?

708
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:01,765
Hat!

709
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,526
Now look.

710
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,762
Well, did you see?

711
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:23,167
And now you turn him away? Such
an old and faithful servant!

712
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:23,868
Swine!

713
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:26,394
After having sucked all the good
out of him you chuck him away like a...

714
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,485
like a banana skin.

715
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:28,453
Really...

716
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:32,392
I can't bear it... any longer...

717
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:36,427
the way he goes on... you've no idea...
it's terrible...

718
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:38,736
I'm going mad...

719
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:40,836
he must go...

720
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,968
I can't bear it... any longer...

721
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:48,037
- He can't bear it.
- Any longer.

722
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:49,766
- He's going mad.
- It's terrible.

723
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,411
How dare you! It's abominable!

724
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,676
Such a good master! Crucify him
like that!

725
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,271
After so many years! Really!

726
00:33:56,465 --> 00:34:00,785
He used to be so kind...so helpful...
and entertaining...my good angel...

727
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:01,666
and now...

728
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:03,898
He's killing me.

729
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,202
- Does he want to replace him?
- I don't know.

730
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:06,688
Ask him.

731
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:10,526
Gentlemen, I don't know what came
over me. Forgive me.

732
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:12,204
Forget all I said.

733
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:15,943
I don't remember exactly what
it was, but you may be sure

734
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,230
there wasn't a word of truth in it.

735
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:21,276
Do I look like a man that can
be made to suffer?

736
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:22,517
Frankly?

737
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,240
What have I done with my pipe?

738
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:30,821
- Charming evening we're having.
- Unforgettable.

739
00:34:30,824 --> 00:34:31,584
And it's not over.

740
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:33,478
- Apparently not.
- It's only beginning.

741
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:35,277
- It's awful.
- Worse than the pantomime.

742
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,774
- The circus.
- The music-hall.

743
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:37,503
The circus.

744
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,462
What can I have done with that briar?

745
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,179
He's a scream. He's lost his dudeen.

746
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,195
I'll be back.

747
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:47,503
End of the corridor, on the left.
Keep my seat.

748
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,069
I've lost my Kapp and Peterson!

749
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,150
He'll be the death of me!

750
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,750
You didn't see by any chance?
Oh! He's gone!

751
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:55,732
Without saying goodbye! How could he!
He might have waited!

752
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:56,601
He would have burst.

753
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,579
Who? Who in that case...

754
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:58,315
- Come here.
- What for?

755
00:34:58,321 --> 00:34:59,291
- You'll see.
- You want me to get up?

756
00:34:59,289 --> 00:34:59,909
Quick!

757
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:07,593
Look!

758
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,336
Oh I say!

759
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:13,714
It's all over.

760
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:22,347
He's not pleased.

761
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,262
You missed a treat. Pity.

762
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:40,283
He subsides.

763
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:44,443
Indeed all subsides.

764
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,280
A great calm descends.

765
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,203
Listen!

766
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:57,623
Pan sleeps.

767
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,015
Will night never come?

768
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,420
You don't feel like going until
it does?

769
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,192
Well you see?

770
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,969
Why it's very natural, very natural.

771
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:09,924
I myself in your situation, if
I had an appointment with a Godet...

772
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,497
Godin...

773
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Godet...

774
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,001
Godot...

775
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:19,174
Anyhow, you see who I mean,...

776
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,940
I'd wait till it was black night
before I gave up.

777
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,285
I'd very much like to sit down,..

778
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:33,375
but I don't quite know how to go
about it.

779
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:37,725
Could I be of any help?

780
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,495
- If you asked me perhaps.
- What?

781
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:40,569
If you asked me to sit down.

782
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:42,746
- Would that be a help?
- I fancy so.

783
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:44,622
Here we go.

784
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,846
Be seated, Sir, I beg of you.

785
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,191
No no, I wouldn't think of it!

786
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:53,983
Ask me again.

787
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:58,739
Come come, take a seat I beseech you,
you'll get pneumonia.

788
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,486
You really think so?

789
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,410
It's absolutely certain.

790
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,901
No doubt you are right.
Thank you, dear fellow.

791
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,198
Done it again!

792
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,210
But I must really be getting along,
if I am to observe my schedule.

793
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,373
Time has stopped.

794
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:15,568
Don't you believe it, Sir,
don't you believe it.

795
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:18,819
Whatever you like, but not that.

796
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,059
Everything seems black to him today.

797
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,075
Except the firmament.

798
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:25,718
But I see what it is,..

799
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:30,048
...you are not from these parts, you
don't know what our twilights can do.

800
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,095
Shall I tell you?

801
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,200
I can't refuse you.

802
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,063
Have you...

803
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:38,995
- Where was I?
- Let's go.

804
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Ah yes! The night.

805
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:41,794
Look!

806
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:43,875
Will you look at the sky, pig!

807
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,201
Good, that's enough.

808
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:50,602
What is there so extraordinary
about it?

809
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:51,897
Qua sky.

810
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,790
It is pale and luminous like any
sky at this hour of the day.

811
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,618
At this time a year...

812
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,861
In these latitudes.

813
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,157
When the weather is fine.

814
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:08,665
An hour ago...

815
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,388
...roughly after having poured
forth even since say...

816
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,657
...ten o'clock in the morning tirelessly
torrents of red and white light...

817
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:25,522
...it begins to lose its effulgence,..

818
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,139
...to grow pale...

819
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:30,401
pale...

820
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,243
...ever a little paler,..

821
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:37,718
a little paler

822
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,473
until...

823
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:41,745
pppfff!

824
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Finished!

825
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,810
It comes to rest.

826
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:48,872
But?

827
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:53,757
But behind this veil of gentleness
and peace,..

828
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:59,646
night is charging and will burst
upon us...

829
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,414
pop!

830
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:06,996
Like that!

831
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,291
Just when we least expect it.

832
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,151
That's how it is on this bitch
of an earth.

833
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,221
So long as one knows.

834
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:19,408
One can bide one's time.

835
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,270
One knows what to expect.

836
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,499
No further need to worry.

837
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,000
Simply wait.

838
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:25,225
We're used to it.

839
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,240
Gentleman!

840
00:39:27,216 --> 00:39:27,976
How did you find me?

841
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Good?

842
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,272
Fair?

843
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:33,293
Middling?

844
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,640
Poor?

845
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,500
Positively bad?

846
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,281
Oh very good, very very good.

847
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:44,095
And you, Sir?

848
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:48,283
Oh tray bong, tray tray tray bong.

849
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,133
That’s ok.

850
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,072
Bless you.

851
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,243
I have such need of encouragement!

852
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:57,791
I weakened a little towards the end,
you didn't notice?

853
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,984
Oh perhaps just a teeny weeny
little bit.

854
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,314
I thought it was intentional.

855
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:06,081
You see my memory...

856
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,500
...is defective.

857
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:24,019
In the meantime, nothing happens.

858
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,256
You find it tedious?

859
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:26,107
Somewhat.

860
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:26,997
And you, Sir?

861
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:28,848
I've been better entertained.

862
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,244
Gentlemen,..

863
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,314
you have been civil to me.

864
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,309
- Not at all!
- What an idea!

865
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,220
Yes yes, you have been correct.

866
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:43,038
So that I ask myself is there anything
I can do in my turn for these

867
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:45,792
honest fellows who are having
such a dull,..

868
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:47,303
...dull time.

869
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,014
Even fifty pence would be a help.

870
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:49,871
We are not beggars!

871
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:53,914
Is there anything I can do, that's
what I ask myself, to cheer them up?

872
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:56,955
I have given them bones, I have
talked to them about this...

873
00:40:57,364 --> 00:41:00,154
and that, I have explained the
twilight, admittedly. But is it enough,

874
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:02,384
that's what tortures me, is it enough?

875
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:04,278
- Even twenty five.
- That's enough!

876
00:41:04,466 --> 00:41:06,116
- I couldn't accept less.
- Is it enough?

877
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,381
No doubt.

878
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:11,371
But I am liberal. It's my nature.

879
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:13,931
This evening.

880
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,916
So much the worse for me.

881
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,788
For I shall suffer,

882
00:41:28,502 --> 00:41:30,272
no doubt about that.

883
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:36,468
What do you prefer?

884
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,073
Shall we have him dance,..

885
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:42,573
or sing...

886
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,271
or recite,..

887
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:46,721
- or think, or?
- Who?

888
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,055
Who!

889
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,889
You know how to think, you two?

890
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,240
- He thinks?
- Certainly.

891
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,372
Aloud.

892
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:55,233
He even used to think very prettily once,
I could listen to him for hours.

893
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:57,387
Now...

894
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,332
So much the worse for me.

895
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:06,638
Well, show we have him to think
something for us?

896
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:09,716
- I'd rather he dance, it'd be more fun.
- Not necessarily.

897
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,730
Wouldn't it, Didi, be more fun?

898
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:13,719
I'd like well to hear him think.

899
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:16,397
Perhaps he could dance first
and think afterwards,..

900
00:42:16,753 --> 00:42:18,163
if it isn't too much to ask him.

901
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:19,274
Would that be possible?

902
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:22,445
By all means, nothing simpler.
It's the natural order.

903
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:23,603
Then let him dance.

904
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,798
Do you hear, hog?

905
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,245
He never refuses?

906
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:30,509
He refused once.

907
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:35,233
Dance, misery!

908
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,507
Is that all?

909
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:55,965
Encore!

910
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,749
I'd do as well myself.

911
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:11,701
With a little practice.

912
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:12,904
He is tired.

913
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:16,558
He used to dance the farandole,
the fling, the brawl, the jig,..

914
00:43:16,782 --> 00:43:20,342
the fandango and even the hornpipe.
He capered. For joy.

915
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:22,626
Now that's the best he can do.

916
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,219
Do you know what he calls it?

917
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:25,595
The Scapegoat's Agony.

918
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,142
The Hard Stool.

919
00:43:29,028 --> 00:43:29,748
The Net.

920
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,685
He thinks he's entangled in a net.

921
00:43:37,538 --> 00:43:38,678
Nobody comes,..

922
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,286
nobody goes,..

923
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:42,764
it's awful!

924
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:44,281
Tell him to think.

925
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:45,183
Give him his hat.

926
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:46,086
His hat?

927
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:47,275
He can't think without his hat.

928
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,740
Give him his hat.

929
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,799
Me! After what he did to me!
Never!

930
00:43:51,382 --> 00:43:52,312
I'll give it to him.

931
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:53,446
Tell him to go and fetch it.

932
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,500
It's better to give it to him.

933
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:55,585
I'll give it to him.

934
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,299
You must put it on his head.

935
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:01,206
Tell him to take it.

936
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,335
It's better to put it on his head.

937
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,575
I'll put it on his head.

938
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,378
What's he waiting for?

939
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,620
Stand back!

940
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:19,916
Think, pig!

941
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:21,949
Stop!

942
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,800
Forward!

943
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Stop!

944
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:25,482
Think!

945
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:26,497
On the other hand with regard to?

946
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,000
Stop!

947
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,500
Back!

948
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,099
Stop!

949
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:35,641
Think!

950
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:50,302
Given the existence as uttered
forth in the public works of Puncher

951
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:56,069
and Wattmann of a personal God
quaquaquaqua

952
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:00,389
with white beard quaquaquaqua

953
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:05,267
outside time without extension

954
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,843
who from the heights of divine apathia

955
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:13,072
divine athambia divine aphasia

956
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,878
loves us dearly

957
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:18,563
with some exceptions

958
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:23,227
for reasons unknown but time
will tell

959
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:27,696
and suffers like the divine Miranda
with those who

960
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:35,120
for reasons unknown but time will tell
are plunged in torment plunged in fire

961
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:39,217
whose fire flames if that continues
and who can doubt it will fire

962
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:44,046
the firmament that is to say blast
hell to heaven

963
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:49,332
so blue still and calm

964
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:55,002
so calm with a calm which even though
intermittent is better than nothing

965
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but not so fast and considering
what is more

966
00:45:57,995 --> 00:45:58,955
that as a result of

967
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,000
the labors left unfinished crowned
by the Acacacacademy of Anthropopopometry

968
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
of Essy-in-Possy of Testew and Cunard
it is established beyond all doubt

969
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
all other doubt than that which clings
to the labors of men that as a result

970
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
of the labors unfinished of Testew
and Cunnard it is established as

971
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,020
hereinafter but not so fast for reasons
unknown that as a result of the public

972
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:23,004
works of Puncher and Wattmann it is
established beyond all doubt

973
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
that in view of the labors of Fartov and Belcher
left unfinished for reasons unknown of Testew

974
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,400
and Cunard left unfinished

975
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:32,488
it is established what many deny

976
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:34,895
that man in Possy of Testew and Cunard

977
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:36,799

Avenged!

Give me that!

1023
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:06,834
There's an end to his thinking!

1024
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,738
But will he be able to orientate
himself?

1025
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:10,795
I will orientate him!

1026
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:16,499
Up pig!

1027
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Perhaps he's dead.

1028
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,670
You'll kill him.

1029
00:49:19,383 --> 00:49:20,813
Up scum!

1030
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,000

How?

1032
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:25,809
Raise him up!

1033
00:49:36,216 --> 00:49:38,066
He's doing it on purpose!

1034
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:39,007
You must hold him.

1035
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:40,837
Come on, come on, raise him up.

1036
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:41,597
To hell with him!

1037
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,324
Come on, once more.

1038
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,149
-What does he take us for?
-Come on!

1039
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,565
Don't let him go!

1040
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:58,681
Don't move!

1041
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:00,342
Hold him tight!

1042
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:11,283
Don't let him go!

1043
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:17,463
Don’t move!

1044
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,032
Now! You can let him go.

1045
00:50:57,316 --> 00:50:58,276
Forward!

1046
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,200
Stop!

1047
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Back!

1048
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Stop!

1049
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,500
Turn!

1050
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:28,579
Done it!

1051
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,908
He can walk.

1052
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:34,871
Thank you, gentlemen,..

1053
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,430
thank you

1054
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:37,676
and let me...

1055
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,816
let me wish you...

1056
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,353
wish you...

1057
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:43,617
what have I done with my watch?

1058
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,010
A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen,

1059
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:48,703
with deadbeat escapement!

1060
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,130
Twas my granpa gave it to me!

1061
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:53,813
Perhaps I dropped it.

1062
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:57,484
Well now isn't that just?

1063
00:51:57,476 --> 00:51:58,436
Perhaps it's in your fob.

1064
00:51:58,998 --> 00:51:59,888
Wait!

1065
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,548
I hear nothing.

1066
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,403
Come in here and listen.

1067
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,578
Surely one should hear the tick-tick.

1068
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:14,413
Silence!

1069
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:15,836
-I hear something.
-Where?

1070
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,638
- It's the heart.
- Damnation!

1071
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:18,348
Silence!

1072
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,330
Perhaps it has stopped.

1073
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:23,853
Which of you smells so bad?

1074
00:52:24,301 --> 00:52:26,521
He has stinking breath and
I have stinking feet.

1075
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:28,947
I must go.

1076
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:30,857
And your half-hunter?

1077
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,200
I must have left it at the manor.

1078
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:36,524
On the stain way.

1079
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:40,954
-Then adieu
-Adieu

1080
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:41,915
-Adieu
-Adieu

1081
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:44,451
-Adieu
-Adieu

1082
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:45,197
Adieu.

1083
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:46,919
-And thank you.
-Thank you.

1084
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,030
-Not at all.
-Yes yes.

1085
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:49,518
-No no.
-Yes yes.

1086
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:50,616
No no.

1087
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:55,463
I don't seem...

1088
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,248
...to be able...

1089
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,182
to depart.

1090
00:53:00,585 --> 00:53:01,905
Such is life.

1091
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:04,913
You're going the wrong way.

1092
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,629
I need a running start.

1093
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:10,444
Stand back!

1094
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:12,510
On!

1095
00:53:12,507 --> 00:53:13,087
On!

1096
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:14,294
On!

1097
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,340
Faster!

1098
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,996
- Faster!
- Faster!

1099
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:18,618
Back!

1100
00:53:19,468 --> 00:53:20,408
Stool!

1101
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:21,702
-Stool!
-Stool!

1102
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,475
Stool!

1103
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,670
Stool!

1104
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,200
Stool!

1105
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,100
On!

1106
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,100
On!

1107
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,100
On!

1108
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,800
Adieu!

1109
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:40,909
Adieu!

1110
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:43,986
Adieu!

1111
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,970
Adieu!

1112
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,379
Adieu!

1113
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:55,263
Adieu!

1114
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,100
That passed the time.

1115
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,100
It would have passed in any case.

1116
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,101
Yes, but not so rapidly.

1117
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:12,601
What do we do now?

1118
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:13,601
I don't know.

1119
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:14,352
Let's go.

1120
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:15,084
We can't.

1121
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:15,726
Why not?

1122
00:54:15,882 --> 00:54:16,682
We're waiting for Godot.

1123
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:17,727
Ah! Yes.

1124
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,500
How they've changed!

1125
00:54:20,603 --> 00:54:21,103
Who?

1126
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:22,403
Those two.

1127
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,719
That's the idea, let's make
a little conversation.

1128
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:26,885
-Haven't they?
-What?

1129
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:27,374
Changed.

1130
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:29,901
Very likely. They all change.
Only we can't.

1131
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:32,158
Likely! It's certain. Didn't you
see them?

1132
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:33,936
I suppose I did. But I don't
know them.

1133
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:34,775
Yes you do know them.

1134
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:35,806
No I don't know them.

1135
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,913
We know them, I tell you.
You forget everything.

1136
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:41,167
Unless they're not the same...

1137
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,088
Why didn't they recognize us then?

1138
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:48,131
That means nothing. I too pretended
not to recognize them.

1139
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,941
And then nobody ever recognizes us.

1140
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,170
Forget it.

1141
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:55,198
What we need? Ow!

1142
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,330
Ow!

1143
00:54:59,118 --> 00:55:00,618
Unless they're not the same...

1144
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,116
Didi! It's the other foot!

1145
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,067
Unless they're not the same...

1146
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:13,641
Mister!

1147
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,210
Off we go again.

1148
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:23,398
Approach, my child.

1149
00:55:25,853 --> 00:55:26,953
Mister Albert...?

1150
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:28,455
Yes.

1151
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:30,646
What do you want?

1152
00:55:30,654 --> 00:55:31,624
Approach!

1153
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,260
Approach when you're told, can't you?

1154
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:39,788
What is it?

1155
00:55:40,323 --> 00:55:41,123
Mr. Godot...

1156
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,171
Obviously...

1157
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:44,679
Approach.

1158
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:47,107
Will you approach!

1159
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,060
What kept you so late?

1160
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:50,278
You have a message from Mr. Godot?

1161
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:51,423
Yes Sir.

1162
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:52,784
Well, what is it?

1163
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,403
What kept you so late?

1164
00:55:54,627 --> 00:55:55,227
Let him alone.

1165
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,977
You let me alone.
Do you know what time it is?

1166
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,471
It's not my fault, Sir.

1167
00:55:58,465 --> 00:55:59,505
And whose is it? Mine?

1168
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:01,528
I was afraid, Sir.

1169
00:56:01,701 --> 00:56:02,381
Afraid of what?

1170
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:03,756
Of us?

1171
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:05,137
Answer me!

1172
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:07,173
I know what it is, he was afraid of
the others.

1173
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,600
How long have you been here?

1174
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:10,797
A good while, Sir.

1175
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:12,201
You were afraid of the whip?

1176
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,800
Yes Sir.

1177
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,610
The roars?

1178
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:16,031
Yes Sir.

1179
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:17,772
The two big men.

1180
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:18,786
Yes Sir.

1181
00:56:19,361 --> 00:56:19,991
Do you know them?

1182
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:21,663
No Sir.

1183
00:56:22,956 --> 00:56:24,296
Are you a native of these parts?

1184
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:27,877
Do you belong to these parts?

1185
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:28,981
Yes Sir.

1186
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:31,724
That's all a pack of lies.
Tell us the truth!

1187
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:32,896
But it is the truth, Sir!

1188
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:34,809
Will you let him alone!
What's the matter with you?

1189
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:37,154
What's the matter with you?

1190
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:42,850
I'm unhappy.

1191
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:44,861
Not really! Since when?

1192
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:46,881
I'd forgotten.

1193
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:49,682
Extraordinary the tricks that
memory plays!

1194
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:08,669
Well?

1195
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:09,759
Mr. Godot?

1196
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,088
I've seen you before, haven't I?

1197
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,905
I don't know, Sir.

1198
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:14,765
You don't know me?

1199
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:15,919
No Sir.

1200
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:18,279
It wasn't you came yesterday?

1201
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:19,948
No Sir.

1202
00:57:20,716 --> 00:57:22,016
This is your first time?

1203
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:23,606
Yes Sir.

1204
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,967
Words...

1205
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:30,209
words...

1206
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:33,979
Speak.

1207
00:57:35,313 --> 00:57:38,603
Mr. Godot told me to tell you
he won't come this evening

1208
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:40,061
but surely tomorrow.

1209
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:43,534
Is that all?

1210
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:45,372
Yes Sir.

1211
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:48,476
You work for Mr. Godot?

1212
00:57:49,515 --> 00:57:50,305
Yes Sir.

1213
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:52,659
What do you do?

1214
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:55,537
I mind the goats, Sir.

1215
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:58,821
Is he good to you?

1216
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:00,145
Yes Sir.

1217
00:58:01,775 --> 00:58:02,715
He doesn't beat you?

1218
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,826
No Sir, not me.

1219
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:07,313
Whom does he beat?

1220
00:58:08,574 --> 00:58:09,864
He beats my brother, Sir.

1221
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:11,781
Ah, you have a brother?

1222
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:12,836
Yes Sir.

1223
00:58:14,642 --> 00:58:15,432
What does he do?

1224
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:17,729
He minds the sheep, Sir.

1225
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:20,627
And why doesn't he beat you?

1226
00:58:21,453 --> 00:58:22,383
I don't know, Sir.

1227
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,623
He must be fond of you.

1228
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,710
I don't know, Sir.

1229
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:33,642
Does he give you enough to eat?

1230
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:36,838
Does he feed you well?

1231
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:38,908
Fairly well, Sir.

1232
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:42,013
You're not unhappy?

1233
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:44,913
Do you hear me?

1234
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:45,979
Yes Sir.

1235
00:58:46,752 --> 00:58:47,682
Well?

1236
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:51,018
I don't know, Sir.

1237
00:58:52,303 --> 00:58:54,013
You don't know if you're unhappy
or not?

1238
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:55,594
No Sir.

1239
00:58:57,475 --> 00:58:58,865
You're as bad as myself.

1240
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:03,998
Where do you sleep?

1241
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,443
In the loft, Sir.

1242
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,458
With your brother?

1243
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,300
Yes Sir.

1244
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:08,167
In the hay?

1245
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,547
Yes Sir.

1246
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,191
All right, you may go.

1247
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:22,446
What am I to tell Mr. Godot, Sir?

1248
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:25,184
Tell him...

1249
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,523
...tell him you saw us.

1250
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,670
You did see us, didn't you?

1251
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:07,949
At last!

1252
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:36,535
What are you doing?

1253
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:39,481
Pale for weariness.

1254
01:00:39,676 --> 01:00:40,176
Eh?

1255
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:43,309
Of climbing heaven and gazing
on the likes of us.

1256
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,093
Your boots, what are you doing
with your boots?

1257
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:46,418
I'm leaving them there.

1258
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:49,179
Another will come, just as...
as...as me,..

1259
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:51,173
but with smaller feet, and
they'll make him happy.

1260
01:00:51,582 --> 01:00:52,532
But you can't go barefoot!

1261
01:00:52,678 --> 01:00:53,598
Christ did.

1262
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:55,936
Christ! What has Christ got
to do with it.

1263
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,483
You're not going to compare
yourself to Christ!

1264
01:00:57,735 --> 01:01:00,595
All my life I've compared myself
to him.

1265
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:03,074
But where he lived it was warm,
it was dry!

1266
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,882
Yes. And they crucified quick.

1267
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:10,517
We've nothing more to do here.

1268
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,910
Nor anywhere else.

1269
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,040
Ah Gogo, don't go on like that.
Tomorrow everything will be better.

1270
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:16,243
How do you make that out?

1271
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:17,538
Did you not hear what the child said?

1272
01:01:17,537 --> 01:01:18,027
No.

1273
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:20,407
He said that Godot was sure to
come tomorrow.

1274
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:21,544
What do you say to that?

1275
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:23,516
Then all we have to do is to
wait on here.

1276
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,571
Are you mad? We must take cover.

1277
01:01:25,774 --> 01:01:26,334
Come on.

1278
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,204
Pity we haven't got a bit of rope.

1279
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,558
Come on. It's cold.

1280
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:42,409
Remind me to bring a bit of rope
tomorrow.

1281
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:43,479
Yes. Come on.

1282
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:50,073
How long have we been together
all the time now?

1283
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:51,223
I don't know.

1284
01:01:51,516 --> 01:01:52,426
Fifty years perhaps.

1285
01:01:52,924 --> 01:01:55,554
Do you remember the day I threw
myself into the Rhone?

1286
01:01:56,304 --> 01:01:57,344
We were grape harvesting.

1287
01:01:57,438 --> 01:01:58,448
You fished me out.

1288
01:01:58,743 --> 01:02:00,143
That's all dead and buried.

1289
01:02:00,326 --> 01:02:02,306
My clothes dried in the sun.

1290
01:02:02,312 --> 01:02:04,802
There's no good harking back on that.
Come on.

1291
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:06,168
-Wait!
-I'm cold!

1292
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,226
Wait!

1293
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:15,694
I sometimes wonder if we wouldn't
have been better off alone,..

1294
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:19,151
...each one for himself.

1295
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:33,325
We weren't made for the same road.

1296
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:39,976
It's not certain.

1297
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:41,199
No!

1298
01:02:42,673 --> 01:02:44,423
Nothing is certain.

1299
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:47,569
We can still part, if you think it
would be better.

1300
01:02:48,384 --> 01:02:50,114
It's not worthwhile now.

1301
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:51,201
No!

1302
01:02:52,513 --> 01:02:53,953
It's not worthwhile now.

1303
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:06,689
Well?

1304
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:08,306
Shall we go?

1305
01:03:08,904 --> 01:03:09,944
Yes.

1306
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:11,957
Let's go.

1307
01:04:15,057 --> 01:04:16,977
A dog came in...

1308
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:21,955
A dog came in the kitchen
And stole a crust of bread.

1309
01:04:22,143 --> 01:04:25,483
Then cook up with a ladle
And beat him till he was dead.

1310
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:29,335
Then all the dogs came running
And dug the dog a tomb...

1311
01:04:33,214 --> 01:04:36,154
Then all the dogs came running
And dug the dog a tomb

1312
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:39,440
And wrote upon the tombstone
For the eyes of dogs to come:

1313
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:42,799
A dog came in the kitchen
And stole a crust of bread.

1314
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,120
Then cook up with a ladle
And beat him till he was dead.

1315
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:49,798
Then all the dogs came running
And dug the dog a tomb...

1316
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:55,726
Then all the dogs came running

1317
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,620
And dug the dog a tomb...

1318
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:03,649
And dug the dog a tomb . . .

1319
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,387
You again!

1320
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:13,438
Come here till I embrace you.

1321
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:15,578
Don't touch me!

1322
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,780
Do you want me to go away?

1323
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:18,665
Gogo!

1324
01:05:19,622 --> 01:05:20,462
Did they beat you?

1325
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:22,249
Gogo!

1326
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,940
Where did you spend the night?

1327
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,770
Don't touch me! Don't question me!
Don't speak to me! Stay with me!

1328
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:30,883
- Did I ever leave you?
-You let me go

1329
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:32,141
Look at me.

1330
01:05:33,025 --> 01:05:34,825
Will you look at me!

1331
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,064
What a day!

1332
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:40,959
Who beat you? Tell me.

1333
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:42,298
Another day done with.

1334
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:43,254
Not yet.

1335
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:46,001
For me it's over and done with,
no matter what happens.

1336
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:47,915
I heard you singing.

1337
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:48,940
That's right, I remember.

1338
01:05:49,235 --> 01:05:49,965
That finished me.

1339
01:05:50,135 --> 01:05:55,475
I said to myself, He's all alone,
he thinks I'm gone for ever, and he sings.

1340
01:05:55,757 --> 01:05:57,487
One is not master of one's moods.

1341
01:05:57,937 --> 01:06:00,637
All day I've felt in great form.
I didn't get up in the night, not once!

1342
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:02,942
You see, you piss better when
I'm not there.

1343
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,466
I missed you... and at the same
time I was happy.

1344
01:06:05,902 --> 01:06:06,772
Isn't that a strange thing?

1345
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:07,442
Happy?

1346
01:06:07,444 --> 01:06:09,204
Perhaps it's not quite the right word.

1347
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:09,705
And now?

1348
01:06:10,062 --> 01:06:12,212
And now?..There you are again...

1349
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:15,625
There we are again.

1350
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:18,914
There I am again.

1351
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:23,483
You see, you feel worse when
I'm with you. I feel better alone too.

1352
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:25,099
Then why do you always come
crawling back?

1353
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:26,035
I don't know.

1354
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:28,212
No, but I do. It's because you don't
know how to defend yourself.

1355
01:06:28,214 --> 01:06:29,204
I wouldn't have let them beat you.

1356
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:30,834
- You couldn't have stopped them.
- Why not?

1357
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:31,739
There was ten of them.

1358
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:32,827
No, I mean before they beat you.

1359
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:34,707
I would have stopped you from doing
whatever it was you were doing.

1360
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:36,196
I wasn't doing anything.

1361
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,030
- Then why did they beat you?
- I don't know.

1362
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,610
Ah no, Gogo,..

1363
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:42,724
...the truth is there are things
that escape you that don't escape me,..

1364
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:43,708
...you must feel it yourself.

1365
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,998
I tell you I wasn't doing anything.

1366
01:06:44,998 --> 01:06:45,918
Perhaps you weren't.

1367
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:47,967
But it's the way of doing it
that counts,..

1368
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,991
the way of doing it, if you
want to go on living.

1369
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,500
But it not enough that.

1370
01:06:52,753 --> 01:06:55,133
There you are back and there
i am happy.

1371
01:06:57,052 --> 01:06:59,232
I wasn't doing anything.

1372
01:06:59,226 --> 01:07:01,296
You must be happy too, deep down,
if you only knew it.

1373
01:07:01,577 --> 01:07:02,907
Happy about what?

1374
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:04,121
To be back with me again.

1375
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:04,904
Would you say so?

1376
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:06,543
Say you are, even if it's not true.

1377
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:07,637
What am I to say?

1378
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,964
Say, I am happy.

1379
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,880
I am happy.

1380
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:13,237
So am I.

1381
01:07:13,513 --> 01:07:14,593
So am I.

1382
01:07:14,938 --> 01:07:16,138
We are happy.

1383
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:17,504
We are happy.

1384
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:25,593
Well. What do we do now, now
that we are happy?

1385
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,494
Wait for Godot.

1386
01:07:28,064 --> 01:07:29,724
Oh, yes.

1387
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:38,118
Things have changed here
since yesterday.

1388
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,420
And if he doesn't come?

1389
01:07:40,836 --> 01:07:42,296
We'll see when the time comes.

1390
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:45,121
I was saying that things have
changed here since yesterday.

1391
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:46,236
Everything oozes.

1392
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:47,186
Look at the tree.

1393
01:07:47,185 --> 01:07:50,455
It's never the same pus from
one second to the next.

1394
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:51,764
The tree, look at the tree.

1395
01:08:05,911 --> 01:08:07,381
And was it not there yesterday?

1396
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,292
Yes of course it was there yesterday.

1397
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,911
Do you not remember? We nearly
hanged ourselves from it.

1398
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:13,263
That’s right.

1399
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:15,320
All but hanged ourselves from it.

1400
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:17,279
But you wouldn't. Do you not
remember?

1401
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:18,246
You dreamt it.

1402
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,740
Is it possible you've forgotten already?

1403
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,629
That's the way I am. Either I forget
immediately or I never forget.

1404
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:25,609
And Pozzo and Lucky, have you
forgotten them too?

1405
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,470
Pozzo and Lucky?

1406
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:27,672
He's forgotten everything!

1407
01:08:27,673 --> 01:08:30,313
I remember a lunatic who kicked
the shins off me.

1408
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:31,201
Then he played the fool.

1409
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:31,891
That was Lucky.

1410
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,560
I remember that. But when was it?

1411
01:08:33,564 --> 01:08:34,774
And his keeper, do you not remember him?

1412
01:08:34,771 --> 01:08:36,301
- He gave me a bone.
- That was Pozzo.

1413
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:37,978
And all that was yesterday, you say?

1414
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:39,217
Yes of course it was yesterday.

1415
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:40,597
And here where we are now?

1416
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:42,868
Where else do you think?
Do you not recognize the place?

1417
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,079
Recognize!

1418
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:46,622
What is there to recognize?

1419
01:08:47,126 --> 01:08:50,656
All my lousy life I've crawled
about in the mud! And you talk...

1420
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:56,136
...to me about scenery! Look at this
muckheap! I've never stirred from it!

1421
01:08:56,469 --> 01:08:57,889
Calm yourself, calm yourself.

1422
01:08:57,885 --> 01:09:00,955
You and your landscapes! Tell me
about the worms!

1423
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:04,176
All the same, you can't tell me
that this bears any resemblance to...

1424
01:09:04,564 --> 01:09:07,534
...to the Macon country for example.
You can't deny there's a big difference.

1425
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:11,046
The Macon country! Who's talking
to you about the Macon country?

1426
01:09:11,054 --> 01:09:13,004
But you were there yourself,
in the Macon country.

1427
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:15,207
No I was never in the Macon country!

1428
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:19,826
I've puked my puke of a life away here,
I tell you! Here! In the Cackon country!

1429
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:21,601
But we were there together,
I could swear to it!

1430
01:09:21,928 --> 01:09:23,488
Picking grapes for a man called...

1431
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:27,666
...can't think of the name of the man,
at a place called...

1432
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:30,971
...can't think of the name of the place,
do you not remember?

1433
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:34,009
Yes. It's possible. I didn't notice anything.

1434
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:36,311
But down there everything is red!

1435
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:39,059
I didn't notice anything, I tell you!

1436
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:44,844
You're a hard man to get on with, Gogo.

1437
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:46,941
It'd be better if we parted.

1438
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:49,854
You always say that and you always
come crawling back.

1439
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:53,490
The best thing would be to kill me,
like the other.

1440
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:54,887
What other?

1441
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:57,892
What other?

1442
01:09:58,613 --> 01:10:00,063
Like billions of others.

1443
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:03,551
To every man his little cross.

1444
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,135
Till he dies.

1445
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:10,237
And is forgotten.

1446
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:17,929
In the meantime let us try and
converse calmly,..

1447
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:21,025
...since we are incapable of
keeping silent.

1448
01:10:21,322 --> 01:10:23,472
You're right, we're inexhaustible.

1449
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:25,504
It's so we won't think.

1450
01:10:25,772 --> 01:10:26,892
We have that excuse.

1451
01:10:26,886 --> 01:10:28,056
It's so we won't hear.

1452
01:10:28,452 --> 01:10:29,602
We have our reasons.

1453
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:31,772
All the dead voices.

1454
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:33,184
They make a noise like wings.

1455
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:34,291
Like leaves.

1456
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:35,249
Like sand.

1457
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:36,301
Like leaves.

1458
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,722
They all speak together.

1459
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:43,246
Each one to itself.

1460
01:10:43,944 --> 01:10:44,954
Rather they whisper.

1461
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:45,721
They rustle.

1462
01:10:45,715 --> 01:10:46,725
They murmur.

1463
01:10:46,728 --> 01:10:47,978
They rustle.

1464
01:10:50,974 --> 01:10:52,034
What do they say?

1465
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:54,064
They talk about their lives.

1466
01:10:54,064 --> 01:10:55,524
To have lived is not enough for them.

1467
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:56,846
They have to talk about it.

1468
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:58,412
To be dead is not enough for them.

1469
01:10:58,412 --> 01:11:00,002
It is not sufficient.

1470
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:05,105
They make a noise like feathers.

1471
01:11:05,113 --> 01:11:06,123
Like leaves.

1472
01:11:06,383 --> 01:11:07,343
Likes ashes.

1473
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,230
Like leaves.

1474
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:16,558
Say something!

1475
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:18,107
I'm seeking.

1476
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:22,285
Say anything at all!

1477
01:11:22,674 --> 01:11:23,444
What do we do now?

1478
01:11:23,674 --> 01:11:25,134
Wait for Godot.

1479
01:11:25,504 --> 01:11:26,384
Ah! Yes.

1480
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:28,163
This is awful!

1481
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,210
Sing something.

1482
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:29,796
No no!

1483
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:32,645
We could start all over again perhaps.

1484
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:33,865
That should be easy.

1485
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:34,972
It's the start that's difficult.

1486
01:11:34,973 --> 01:11:36,423
You can start from anything.

1487
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,858
Yes, but you have to decide.

1488
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:38,583
True.

1489
01:11:42,444 --> 01:11:43,374
Help me!

1490
01:11:43,368 --> 01:11:44,678
I'm seeking.

1491
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:47,877
When you seek you hear.

1492
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:49,358
- You do.
- That prevents you from finding.

1493
01:11:49,361 --> 01:11:51,501
- It does.
- That prevents you from thinking.

1494
01:11:51,499 --> 01:11:52,629
You think all the same.

1495
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:53,670
No no, it's impossible.

1496
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:56,980
That's the idea, let's contradict
each another.

1497
01:11:56,981 --> 01:11:57,631
Impossible.

1498
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:58,105
You think so?

1499
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,941
We're in no danger of ever thinking
any more.

1500
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,441
Then what are we complaining about?

1501
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:02,869
Thinking is not the worst.

1502
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:05,679
Perhaps not. But at least there's that.

1503
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:07,257
That what?

1504
01:12:08,436 --> 01:12:11,616
That's the idea, let's ask each
other questions.

1505
01:12:11,621 --> 01:12:12,871
What do you mean, at least there's that?

1506
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:15,161
That much less misery.

1507
01:12:15,892 --> 01:12:16,392
True.

1508
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:18,922
Well? If we gave thanks for our mercies?

1509
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,768
What is terrible is to have thought.

1510
01:12:20,772 --> 01:12:22,242
But did that ever happen to us?

1511
01:12:22,508 --> 01:12:23,968
Where are all these corpses from?

1512
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:24,965
These skeletons.

1513
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:25,973
- Tell me that.
- True

1514
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:27,167
We must have thought a little.

1515
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:28,291
At the very beginning.

1516
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,840
A charnel-house! A charnel-house!

1517
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:31,811
You don't have to look.

1518
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:33,102
- You can't help looking.
-True

1519
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:34,394
Try as one may.

1520
01:12:34,386 --> 01:12:35,176
I beg your pardon?

1521
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:36,476
Try as one may.

1522
01:12:37,073 --> 01:12:40,703
We should turn resolutely towards
Nature.

1523
01:12:41,016 --> 01:12:42,806
- We've tried that.
-True.

1524
01:12:43,306 --> 01:12:45,206
- On it's not the worst, I know.
-What?

1525
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:46,069
To have thought.

1526
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:46,737
Obviously.

1527
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:47,859
But we could have done without it.

1528
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,880
Que voulez-vous?

1529
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,199
I beg your pardon?

1530
01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:52,352
Que voulez-vouz.

1531
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:55,698
Ah! Que voulez-vous.

1532
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,121
Exactly.

1533
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,010
That wasn't such a bad little canter.

1534
01:13:00,011 --> 01:13:01,771
Yes, but now we'll have to find
something else.

1535
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:03,229
Let me see.

1536
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:05,134
Let me see.

1537
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:07,702
Let me see.

1538
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:10,196
- Ah!
- Well?

1539
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:11,513
What was I saying, we could go on
from there.

1540
01:13:11,509 --> 01:13:12,219
What were you saying when?

1541
01:13:12,474 --> 01:13:13,104
At the very beginning.

1542
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:14,428
The very beginning of WHAT?

1543
01:13:14,634 --> 01:13:16,284
This evening... I was saying...

1544
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:18,451
I was saying . . .

1545
01:13:18,446 --> 01:13:19,696
I'm not a historian.

1546
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:20,871
Wait...

1547
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,130
we embraced... we were happy...

1548
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:26,689
happy . . . what do we do now
that we're happy...

1549
01:13:27,328 --> 01:13:28,388
go on waiting . . .

1550
01:13:28,386 --> 01:13:30,046
waiting... let me think...
it's coming...

1551
01:13:30,299 --> 01:13:31,989
go on waiting . . . now that
we're happy . . .

1552
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:33,689
let me see... ah! The tree!

1553
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:34,212
The tree?

1554
01:13:34,211 --> 01:13:35,491
-Do you not remember?
-I'm tired.

1555
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,027
Look at it.

1556
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:38,321
I see nothing.

1557
01:13:38,324 --> 01:13:40,234
But yesterday evening it was all
pale and bare like a skeleton.

1558
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,860
And now it's covered with leaves.

1559
01:13:41,861 --> 01:13:42,541
Leaves?

1560
01:13:42,539 --> 01:13:43,349
In a single night.

1561
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:44,275
It must be the Spring.

1562
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:45,553
But in a single night!

1563
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:49,247
We weren't here yesterday, I tell you.
Another of your nightmares.

1564
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:51,838
And where were we yesterday evening
according to you?

1565
01:13:51,837 --> 01:13:55,517
How would I know? In another compartment.
There's no lack of void.

1566
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:56,392
Good.

1567
01:13:56,573 --> 01:13:59,773
We weren't here yesterday evening.
Now what did we do yesterday evening?

1568
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:00,255
Do?

1569
01:14:00,256 --> 01:14:01,176
Try and remember.

1570
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:02,049
Do...

1571
01:14:03,095 --> 01:14:05,045
...I suppose we blathered.

1572
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:06,499
About what?

1573
01:14:06,503 --> 01:14:08,963
Oh . . . this and that I suppose,
nothing in particular.

1574
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,878
Yes, now I remember, yesterday
evening we spent blathering...

1575
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,732
...about nothing in particular.

1576
01:14:16,086 --> 01:14:17,986
That's been going on
now for half a century.

1577
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,443
You don't remember any fact,
any circumstance?

1578
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:21,819
Don't torment me, Didi.

1579
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,073
The sun. The moon. Do you not
remember?

1580
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:24,604
They must have been there, as usual.

1581
01:14:24,596 --> 01:14:26,376
You didn't notice anything out of
the ordinary?

1582
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:27,638
Alas!

1583
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:29,115
And Pozzo? And Lucky?

1584
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,106
- Pozzo?
- The bones.

1585
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:31,383
They were like fishbones.

1586
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,593
It was Pozzo gave them to you.

1587
01:14:32,589 --> 01:14:33,269
I don't know.

1588
01:14:33,267 --> 01:14:33,837
And the kick.

1589
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:35,349
That's right, someone gave me a kick.

1590
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,280
It was Lucky gave it to you.

1591
01:14:36,282 --> 01:14:37,242
And all that was yesterday?

1592
01:14:37,244 --> 01:14:38,234
-Show me your leg.
- Which?

1593
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:39,343
Both. Pull up your trousers.

1594
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:40,964
Pull up your trousers.

1595
01:14:40,962 --> 01:14:41,592
I can't.

1596
01:14:42,605 --> 01:14:43,395
The other.

1597
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:45,759
The other, pig!

1598
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:51,705
There's the wound! Beginning to fester!

1599
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:53,718
And what about it?

1600
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,060
Where are your boots?

1601
01:14:55,063 --> 01:14:56,773
-I must have thrown them away.
-When?

1602
01:14:56,966 --> 01:14:58,056
- I don't know.
- Why?

1603
01:14:58,064 --> 01:14:59,184
I don't know why I don't know!

1604
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:00,963
No, I mean why did you throw them away?

1605
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:02,751
Because they were hurting me!

1606
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:06,311
There they are! At the very spot
where you left them yesterday!

1607
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:20,379
They're not mine.

1608
01:15:20,376 --> 01:15:21,046
Not yours!

1609
01:15:21,053 --> 01:15:23,083
Mine were black. These are brown.

1610
01:15:23,422 --> 01:15:24,382
You're sure yours were black?

1611
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,438
Well they were a kind of gray.

1612
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:26,368
And these are brown.

1613
01:15:26,496 --> 01:15:27,376
Well they're a kind of green.

1614
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:27,830
Show me.

1615
01:15:29,761 --> 01:15:30,601
Well of all the—

1616
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:31,651
You see, all that's a lot of bloody—

1617
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:33,763
Ah! I see what it is. Yes, I see
what's happened.

1618
01:15:33,764 --> 01:15:34,604
All that's a lot of bloody—

1619
01:15:34,603 --> 01:15:37,113
It's elementary. Someone came and
took yours and left you his.

1620
01:15:37,105 --> 01:15:37,555
Why?

1621
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:39,096
His were too tight for him,
so he took yours.

1622
01:15:39,363 --> 01:15:40,853
But mine were too tight.

1623
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,275
For you. Not for him.

1624
01:15:45,494 --> 01:15:46,374
I'm tired!

1625
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,170
- Let's go.
-We can't

1626
01:15:48,267 --> 01:15:48,737
Why not?

1627
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:49,921
We're waiting for Godot.

1628
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:50,797
Ah! Yes.

1629
01:15:53,071 --> 01:15:56,431
What'll we do, what'll we do!

1630
01:15:56,425 --> 01:15:57,955
There's nothing we can do.

1631
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,586
But I can't go on like this!

1632
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:02,679
Would you like a radish?

1633
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:03,582
Is that all there is?

1634
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:05,309
There are radishes and turnips.

1635
01:16:05,313 --> 01:16:06,243
Are there no carrots?

1636
01:16:06,497 --> 01:16:08,487
No. Anyway you overdo it with
your carrots.

1637
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,150
Then give me a radish.

1638
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:17,212
It's black!

1639
01:16:17,608 --> 01:16:18,308
It's a radish.

1640
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,970
I only like the pink ones, you
know that!

1641
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:21,917
Did you not wanted?

1642
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:24,104
I only like the pink ones!

1643
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:25,822
Then give it back to me.

1644
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:32,063
I'll go and get a carrot.

1645
01:16:34,146 --> 01:16:36,306
This is becoming really insignificant.

1646
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,585
Not enough.

1647
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,231
What about trying them.

1648
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,310
I've tried everything.

1649
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,347
No, I mean the boots.

1650
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,299
Would that be a good thing?

1651
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,846
- It'd pass the time.
- I assure you, it'd be an occupation.

1652
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:49,222
- A relaxation.
- A recreation.

1653
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:50,265
- A relaxation.
-Try.

1654
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:51,895
- You'll help me?
- I will of course.

1655
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:56,791
We don't manage too badly, eh Didi,
between the two of us?

1656
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,670
Yes yes. Come on, we'll try the
left first.

1657
01:16:58,669 --> 01:17:04,179
We always find something, eh Didi,
to give us the impression we exist?

1658
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:05,994
Yes yes, we're magicians.

1659
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:09,061
But let us persevere in what we
have resolved, before we forget.

1660
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:11,143
Come on, give me your foot.

1661
01:17:13,074 --> 01:17:14,214
The other, hog!

1662
01:17:15,118 --> 01:17:16,038
Higher!

1663
01:17:21,242 --> 01:17:22,102
Try and walk.

1664
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:29,869
Well?

1665
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:30,370
It fits.

1666
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:31,639
We'll try and lace it.

1667
01:17:31,639 --> 01:17:34,259
No no, no laces, no laces!

1668
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:35,401
You'll be sorry.

1669
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:37,625
Let's try the other.

1670
01:17:54,617 --> 01:17:56,007
- Well?
- It fits too.

1671
01:17:56,368 --> 01:17:57,468
- They don't hurt you?
- Not yet.

1672
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,070
-Then you can keep them.
-They're too big.

1673
01:17:59,336 --> 01:18:00,616
Perhaps you'll have socks some day.

1674
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:01,175
True.

1675
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:03,464
- Then you'll keep them?
- That's enough about these boots.

1676
01:18:03,632 --> 01:18:03,962
Yes, but—

1677
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:05,542
Enough!

1678
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,130
I suppose I might as well sit down.

1679
01:18:13,262 --> 01:18:15,172
That's where you were sitting
yesterday evening.

1680
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:16,589
If I could only sleep.

1681
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:17,612
Yesterday you slept.

1682
01:18:17,881 --> 01:18:18,501
I'll try.

1683
01:18:19,035 --> 01:18:19,545
Wait.

1684
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,880
Bye bye bye bye

1685
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
Bye bye–

1686
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:31,511
Not so loud!

1687
01:18:38,883 --> 01:18:42,883
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

1688
01:18:43,384 --> 01:18:48,894
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye...

1689
01:19:37,805 --> 01:19:38,515
There . . . there . . .

1690
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:39,809
Didi is here... don't be afraid...

1691
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:41,682
There... there... it's all over.

1692
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:42,505
I was falling—

1693
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:43,581
It's all over, it's all over.

1694
01:19:43,802 --> 01:19:44,542
I was on top of a—

1695
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:45,818
Don't tell me!

1696
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:47,852
Come, we'll walk it off.

1697
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:52,457
That's enough. I'm tired.

1698
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:53,862
You'd rather be stuck there doing
nothing?

1699
01:19:53,947 --> 01:19:54,337
Yes.

1700
01:19:54,537 --> 01:19:55,407
Please yourself.

1701
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:57,920
Let's go.

1702
01:19:58,233 --> 01:19:59,033
- We can't.
- Why not?

1703
01:19:59,033 --> 01:20:00,013
We're waiting for Godot.

1704
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:00,929
Ah! Yes.

1705
01:20:03,249 --> 01:20:04,709
Can you not stay still?

1706
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:05,937
I'm cold.

1707
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,400
We came too soon.

1708
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,400
It's always at nightfall.

1709
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
But night doesn't fall.

1710
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:11,385
It'll fall all of a sudden,
like yesterday.

1711
01:20:11,392 --> 01:20:13,212
- Then it'll be night.
- And we can go.

1712
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:16,637
Then it'll be day again. What'll
we do, what'll we do!

1713
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,720
Will you stop whining! I've had about
my bellyful of your lamentations!

1714
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:21,812
I'm going.

1715
01:20:22,975 --> 01:20:23,635
Well!

1716
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:24,371
Farewell.

1717
01:20:24,794 --> 01:20:25,714
Lucky's hat.

1718
01:20:26,315 --> 01:20:28,195
I've been here an hour and
never saw it.

1719
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:30,686
Fine!

1720
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,582
You'll never see me again.

1721
01:20:33,532 --> 01:20:35,072
I knew it was the right place.

1722
01:20:37,456 --> 01:20:38,426
Now our troubles are over.

1723
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:43,795
Must have been a very fine hat.

1724
01:20:45,372 --> 01:20:46,172
- Here
- What?

1725
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:47,078
Hold that.

1726
01:21:53,221 --> 01:21:54,081
How does it fit me?

1727
01:21:54,532 --> 01:21:55,182
How would I know?

1728
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,330
No, but how do I look in it?

1729
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:57,218
Hideous.

1730
01:21:57,558 --> 01:21:59,028
Yes, but not more so than usual?

1731
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:00,084
Neither more nor less.

1732
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:01,147
Then I can keep it.

1733
01:22:01,692 --> 01:22:03,172
Mine irked me.

1734
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,640
How shall I say?

1735
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:06,362
It itched me.

1736
01:22:07,653 --> 01:22:08,303
I'm going.

1737
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:09,291
Will you not play?

1738
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:10,159
Play at what?

1739
01:22:10,455 --> 01:22:11,605
We could play at Pozzo and Lucky.

1740
01:22:11,612 --> 01:22:12,382
Never heard of it.

1741
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:13,741
I'll do Lucky, you do Pozzo.

1742
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:18,843
Go on.

1743
01:22:19,677 --> 01:22:20,667
What am I to do?

1744
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:21,899
Curse me!

1745
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,264
Naughty!

1746
01:22:24,282 --> 01:22:25,342
Stronger!

1747
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,341
Gonococcus! Spirochete!

1748
01:22:30,265 --> 01:22:31,105
Tell me to think.

1749
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,620
What?

1750
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:32,723
Say, Think, pig!

1751
01:22:32,724 --> 01:22:33,544
Think, pig!

1752
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:36,663
I can't.

1753
01:22:36,655 --> 01:22:37,715
That's enough of that.

1754
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:38,927
Tell me to dance.

1755
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:41,031
Dance, hog!

1756
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,019
I'm going.

1757
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,608
I can't!

1758
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,400
Gogo!

1759
01:22:52,435 --> 01:22:53,395
There you are again at last!

1760
01:22:53,397 --> 01:22:54,197
I'm accursed!

1761
01:22:54,455 --> 01:22:55,675
Where were you? I thought you were
gone for ever.

1762
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,340
At for arise. They're coming!

1763
01:22:57,341 --> 01:22:58,181
- Who?
- I don't know.

1764
01:22:58,177 --> 01:22:59,097
- How many?
- I don't know.

1765
01:22:59,447 --> 01:23:03,367
It's Godot! At last! Gogo! It's Godot!
We're saved! Let's go and meet him!

1766
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,359
Gogo! Come back!

1767
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:10,468
There you are again again!

1768
01:23:10,468 --> 01:23:11,188
I'm in hell!

1769
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:11,763
Where were you?

1770
01:23:11,755 --> 01:23:12,735
At for arise.

1771
01:23:13,183 --> 01:23:14,353
No. Don’t want on a plato.

1772
01:23:14,887 --> 01:23:16,317
Served up on a plato.

1773
01:23:16,637 --> 01:23:17,507
They're coming there too!

1774
01:23:17,894 --> 01:23:18,634
We're surrounded!

1775
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:21,882
Imbecile! There's no way out there.

1776
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:26,846
There! Not a soul in sight!

1777
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:28,399
Off you go! Quick!

1778
01:23:29,842 --> 01:23:30,612
You won't?

1779
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:35,094
Well I can understand that.
Wait till I see.

1780
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:37,215
Your only hope left is to disappear.

1781
01:23:37,215 --> 01:23:37,935
Where?

1782
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:39,220
Behind the tree.

1783
01:23:39,484 --> 01:23:40,454
Quick! Behind the tree.

1784
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,830
Decidedly this tree will not have
been the slightest use to us.

1785
01:23:51,613 --> 01:23:55,123
I lost my head. Forgive me.
It won't happen again.

1786
01:23:55,684 --> 01:23:57,554
Tell me what to do.

1787
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:58,890
There's nothing to do.

1788
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,300
You stand there and watch out.

1789
01:24:01,566 --> 01:24:02,526
Don't move!

1790
01:24:07,282 --> 01:24:10,252
Back to back like in the good
old days.

1791
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:14,573
Do you see anything coming?

1792
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:15,057
What?

1793
01:24:15,657 --> 01:24:17,637
Do you see anything coming?

1794
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,209
No.

1795
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:20,309
Nor I.

1796
01:24:21,938 --> 01:24:23,038
You must have had a vision.

1797
01:24:23,202 --> 01:24:23,772
What?

1798
01:24:23,993 --> 01:24:25,603
You must have had a vision.

1799
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,223
There is no need to shout!

1800
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,337
Do you—

1801
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:31,244
Oh pardon!

1802
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:31,726
Carry on.

1803
01:24:31,725 --> 01:24:33,325
- No no, after you.
- No no, you first.

1804
01:24:33,806 --> 01:24:35,126
I interrupted you.

1805
01:24:35,472 --> 01:24:36,802
On the contrary.

1806
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,740
Ceremonious ape!

1807
01:24:38,737 --> 01:24:39,727
Punctilious pig!

1808
01:24:39,727 --> 01:24:40,987
Finish your phrase, I tell you!

1809
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:41,763
Finish your own!

1810
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:43,766
Moron!

1811
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:46,329
That's the idea, let's abuse
each other.

1812
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,700
Moron!

1813
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:51,399
Vermin!

1814
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:52,249
Abortion!

1815
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:52,920
Morpion!

1816
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,530
Sewer-rat!

1817
01:24:53,526 --> 01:24:54,106
Curate!

1818
01:24:54,114 --> 01:24:54,854
Cretin!

1819
01:24:54,853 --> 01:24:55,653
Crritic!

1820
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:58,066
Now let's make it up.

1821
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,283
- Gogo!
- Didi!

1822
01:24:59,278 --> 01:24:59,898
Your hand!

1823
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:00,601
Take it!

1824
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:01,453
Come to my arms!

1825
01:25:01,454 --> 01:25:02,094
Yours arms?

1826
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:03,409
My breast!

1827
01:25:03,409 --> 01:25:04,199
Off we go!

1828
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,276
How time flies when one has fun!

1829
01:25:24,172 --> 01:25:25,232
What do we do now?

1830
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:26,340
While waiting.

1831
01:25:26,335 --> 01:25:27,405
While waiting.

1832
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:29,368
We could do our exercises.

1833
01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:30,309
Our movements.

1834
01:25:30,309 --> 01:25:31,199
Our elevations.

1835
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,729
- Our relaxations.
- Our elongations.

1836
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:33,983
- Our relaxations.
- To warm us up.

1837
01:25:34,266 --> 01:25:35,146
To calm us down.

1838
01:25:35,152 --> 01:25:36,232
Off we go.

1839
01:25:47,754 --> 01:25:49,044
That's enough. I'm tired.

1840
01:25:49,339 --> 01:25:50,519
We're not in form.

1841
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:53,214
What about a little deep breathing?

1842
01:25:53,211 --> 01:25:54,321
I'm tired breathing.

1843
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:55,350
You're right.

1844
01:25:57,697 --> 01:25:59,557
Let's just do the tree, for the
balance.

1845
01:25:59,932 --> 01:26:00,562
The tree?

1846
01:26:10,807 --> 01:26:11,587
Your turn.

1847
01:26:17,686 --> 01:26:18,896
Do you think God sees me?

1848
01:26:18,898 --> 01:26:20,528
You must close your eyes.

1849
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:21,577
God have pity on me!

1850
01:26:21,964 --> 01:26:22,534
And me?

1851
01:26:22,525 --> 01:26:25,205
On me! On me! Pity! On me!

1852
01:26:28,232 --> 01:26:28,972
What is it?

1853
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:29,973
Who is it?

1854
01:26:46,929 --> 01:26:47,739
Is it Godot?

1855
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,220
At last! Reinforcements at last!

1856
01:26:50,222 --> 01:26:50,892
Help!

1857
01:26:50,887 --> 01:26:51,477
Is it Godot?

1858
01:26:51,709 --> 01:26:54,009
We were beginning to weaken. Now
we're sure to see the evening out.

1859
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:54,748
Help!

1860
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:57,662
We are no longer alone, waiting
for the night, waiting for Godot,

1861
01:26:58,144 --> 01:26:58,744
waiting for...

1862
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:00,120
waiting.

1863
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:02,813
All evening we have struggled,
unassisted. Now it's over.

1864
01:27:02,805 --> 01:27:03,745
It's already tomorrow.

1865
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,083
Time flows again already.

1866
01:27:06,343 --> 01:27:10,383
The sun will set, the moon rise,
and we away... from here.

1867
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:11,307
Pity!

1868
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:12,287
Poor Pozzo!

1869
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,710
I knew it was him.

1870
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:14,911
- Who?
- Godot.

1871
01:27:15,108 --> 01:27:15,778
But it's not Godot.

1872
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,550
It's not Godot?

1873
01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:17,337
It's not Godot.

1874
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:18,517
- Then who is it?
- It's Pozzo.

1875
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:20,476
Here! Here! Help me up!

1876
01:27:20,888 --> 01:27:21,478
He can't get up.

1877
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:21,990
Let's go.

1878
01:27:21,994 --> 01:27:22,904
- We can't.
- Why not?

1879
01:27:22,895 --> 01:27:23,795
We're waiting for Godot.

1880
01:27:23,798 --> 01:27:24,588
Ah! Yes.

1881
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,595
Perhaps he has another bone for you.

1882
01:27:26,603 --> 01:27:28,053
- Bone?
- Chicken. Do you not remember?

1883
01:27:28,048 --> 01:27:28,528
It was him?

1884
01:27:28,525 --> 01:27:29,475
- Yes.
- Ask him.

1885
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:33,315
Perhaps we should help him first.

1886
01:27:33,322 --> 01:27:34,402
- To do what?
- To get up.

1887
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:35,493
- He can't get up?
- He wants to get up.

1888
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,180
Then let him get up.

1889
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:36,950
- He can't.
- Why not?

1890
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:37,708
I don't know.

1891
01:27:41,545 --> 01:27:45,755
We should ask him for the bone first.
Then if he refuses we'll leave him there.

1892
01:27:46,383 --> 01:27:47,433
You mean we have him at our mercy?

1893
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:47,949
Yes.

1894
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,606
And that we should subordinate
our good offices to certain conditions?

1895
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:51,448
What?

1896
01:27:52,235 --> 01:27:53,775
That seems intelligent all right.

1897
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,045
But there's one thing I'm afraid of.

1898
01:27:59,046 --> 01:27:59,576
What?

1899
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:04,499
That Lucky might get going all of
a sudden. Then we'd be ballocksed.

1900
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:05,135
Lucky?

1901
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,390
The one that went for you yesterday.

1902
01:28:06,566 --> 01:28:08,016
I tell you there was ten of them.

1903
01:28:08,017 --> 01:28:09,367
No, before that, the one that
kicked you.

1904
01:28:09,369 --> 01:28:10,219
Is he there?

1905
01:28:10,224 --> 01:28:11,334
As large as life.

1906
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:17,389
For the moment he is inert.
But he might run amuck any minute.

1907
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:18,550
Help!

1908
01:28:19,232 --> 01:28:22,882
And suppose we gave him a good
beating, the two of us.

1909
01:28:22,884 --> 01:28:23,994
You mean if we fell on him in
his sleep?

1910
01:28:23,993 --> 01:28:24,553
Yes.

1911
01:28:24,844 --> 01:28:26,584
That seems a good idea all right.

1912
01:28:31,104 --> 01:28:33,334
But could we do it? Is he really
asleep?

1913
01:28:34,046 --> 01:28:36,946
No, the best would be to take advantage
of Pozzo's calling for help—

1914
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:39,155
In anticipation of some tangible return.

1915
01:28:39,161 --> 01:28:39,691
And suppose he—

1916
01:28:39,688 --> 01:28:42,118
Let us not waste our time in idle
discourse!

1917
01:28:43,172 --> 01:28:45,002
Let us do something, while we
have the chance!

1918
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,390
It is not every day that we are
needed.

1919
01:28:47,765 --> 01:28:50,095
Not indeed that we personally
are needed. Others would meet...

1920
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:51,395
the case equally well, if not better.

1921
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:54,040
To all man kind they were addressed,..

1922
01:28:54,278 --> 01:28:56,228
those cries for help still ringing
in our ears!

1923
01:28:56,232 --> 01:28:59,632
But at this place, at this
moment of time, all mankind is us,..

1924
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:00,765
Help!

1925
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:01,968
...whether we like it or not.

1926
01:29:02,324 --> 01:29:04,154
Let us make the most of it, before
it is too late!

1927
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:07,570
Let us represent worthily for once
the foul brood to which a cruel...

1928
01:29:07,569 --> 01:29:08,479
...fate consigned us!

1929
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:09,316
What do you say?

1930
01:29:12,074 --> 01:29:14,974
It is true that when with folded
arms we weigh the pros and cons...

1931
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:16,614
we are no less a credit to our species.

1932
01:29:17,694 --> 01:29:20,924
The tiger bounds to the help of his
congeners without the least reflection,..

1933
01:29:22,145 --> 01:29:24,595
...or else he slinks away
into the depths of the thickets.

1934
01:29:25,138 --> 01:29:26,798
But that is not the question.

1935
01:29:26,804 --> 01:29:29,544
What are we doing here, that
is the question.

1936
01:29:30,021 --> 01:29:32,321
And we are blessed in this, that
we happen to know the answer.

1937
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:36,918
Yes, in this immense confusion
one thing alone is clear.

1938
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:39,009
We are waiting for Godot to come—

1939
01:29:39,013 --> 01:29:39,853
Ah! Yes.

1940
01:29:39,852 --> 01:29:41,132
Or for night to fall.

1941
01:29:41,366 --> 01:29:43,096
We have kept our appointment and
that's an end to that.

1942
01:29:43,787 --> 01:29:46,497
We are not saints, but we have kept
our appointment.

1943
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,650
How many people can boast as much?

1944
01:29:48,855 --> 01:29:49,705
Billions.

1945
01:29:49,714 --> 01:29:51,234
- You think so?
- I don't know.

1946
01:29:51,426 --> 01:29:52,276
You may be right.

1947
01:29:52,283 --> 01:29:52,923
Help!

1948
01:29:54,392 --> 01:29:56,792
All I know is that the hours are long,
under these conditions,..

1949
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,700
...and constrain us to beguile
them with proceedings which

1950
01:30:00,589 --> 01:30:01,389
–how shall I say–

1951
01:30:02,179 --> 01:30:03,979
which may at first sight seem
reasonable,..

1952
01:30:04,835 --> 01:30:06,195
...until they become a habit.

1953
01:30:07,298 --> 01:30:09,748
You may say it is to prevent our
reason from foundering.

1954
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,170
No doubt.

1955
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:14,424
But has it not long been straying
in the night without...

1956
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,000
end of the abyssal depths?

1957
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:17,757
That's what I sometimes wonder.

1958
01:30:18,697 --> 01:30:19,687
You follow my reasoning?

1959
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:24,085
We are all born mad. Some remain so.

1960
01:30:24,093 --> 01:30:26,103
Help! I'll pay you!

1961
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:26,997
How much?

1962
01:30:27,344 --> 01:30:28,574
- A pound!
- It's not enough.

1963
01:30:29,097 --> 01:30:30,167
I wouldn't go so far as that.

1964
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:31,188
You think it's enough?

1965
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,520
No, I mean so far as to assert
that I was weak in the head,..

1966
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,620
when I came into the world.

1967
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,010
But that is not the question.

1968
01:30:36,008 --> 01:30:36,778
Two pounds!

1969
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:38,365
- We wait.
- We are bored.

1970
01:30:38,576 --> 01:30:41,986
No, don't protest, we are bored to
death, there's no denying it.

1971
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:42,929
Good.

1972
01:30:43,316 --> 01:30:44,986
A diversion comes along and
what do we do?

1973
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:46,569
We let it go to waste.

1974
01:30:47,235 --> 01:30:48,315
Come, let's get to work!

1975
01:30:51,281 --> 01:30:54,011
In an instant all will vanish...

1976
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,820
and we'll be alone once more,
in the midst of nothingness!

1977
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:01,029
Two pounds!

1978
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:01,825
We're coming!

1979
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:16,593
What's the matter with you all?

1980
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:17,030
Help!

1981
01:31:17,028 --> 01:31:18,028
I'm going.

1982
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:19,028
Don't leave me!

1983
01:31:19,029 --> 01:31:19,529
Where am I?

1984
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:20,029
Gogo!

1985
01:31:20,317 --> 01:31:21,117
Help!

1986
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:21,831
Help!

1987
01:31:22,029 --> 01:31:22,829
I'm going.

1988
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:24,179
Help me up first, then we'll go
together.

1989
01:31:24,389 --> 01:31:24,989
You promise?

1990
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:25,500
I swear it!

1991
01:31:25,497 --> 01:31:27,067
And we'll never come back again?

1992
01:31:27,259 --> 01:31:27,729
Never!

1993
01:31:27,934 --> 01:31:29,764
We'll go to the Pyrenees.

1994
01:31:29,759 --> 01:31:30,429
Wherever you like.

1995
01:31:30,939 --> 01:31:34,259
I've always wanted to wander
in the Pyrenees.

1996
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:35,223
You'll wander in them.

1997
01:31:36,227 --> 01:31:36,827
Who farted?

1998
01:31:37,014 --> 01:31:37,664
Pozzo.

1999
01:31:37,874 --> 01:31:39,094
Here! Here! Pity!

2000
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,660
It's revolting!

2001
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:42,801
- Quick! Give me your hand!
- I'm going.

2002
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,530
I'm going.

2003
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:50,455
Well I suppose in the end I'll
get up by myself.

2004
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:55,991
In the fullness of time.

2005
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,730
What's the matter with you?

2006
01:31:57,732 --> 01:31:58,462
Go to hell.

2007
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:00,396
- Are you staying there?
- For the time being.

2008
01:32:00,403 --> 01:32:02,303
Come on, get up, you'll catch
a chill.

2009
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,360
Don't worry about me.

2010
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,780
Come on, Didi, don't be pig-headed!

2011
01:32:07,392 --> 01:32:08,092
Pull!

2012
01:32:14,013 --> 01:32:15,063
Help!

2013
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:16,359
We've arrived.

2014
01:32:17,025 --> 01:32:17,825
Who are you?

2015
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:19,190
We are men.

2016
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,010
Oh sweet mother earth!

2017
01:32:24,283 --> 01:32:25,103
Can you get up?

2018
01:32:25,101 --> 01:32:26,451
I don't know.

2019
01:32:26,452 --> 01:32:27,072
Try.

2020
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,942
Not now, not now.

2021
01:32:34,777 --> 01:32:35,787
What happened?

2022
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,649
Will you stop it, you! Pest!

2023
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:40,816
He can think of nothing but himself!

2024
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,548
What about a little snooze?

2025
01:32:42,545 --> 01:32:44,165
Did you hear him? He wants to
know what happened!

2026
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:45,960
Don't mind him. Sleep.

2027
01:32:54,717 --> 01:32:55,697
- Pity!
- What?

2028
01:32:56,498 --> 01:32:57,998
- Pity!
- What is it?

2029
01:32:58,374 --> 01:32:59,584
It's this bastard Pozzo at it again.

2030
01:32:59,785 --> 01:33:01,705
Make him stop it. Kick him in
the crotch.

2031
01:33:02,066 --> 01:33:04,256
Will you stop it! Crablouse!

2032
01:33:13,491 --> 01:33:14,521
LUCKY!

2033
01:33:22,692 --> 01:33:23,312
He's off!

2034
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:24,845
LUCKY!

2035
01:33:25,544 --> 01:33:26,344
He's down!

2036
01:33:27,392 --> 01:33:28,732
What do we do now?

2037
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:30,279
Perhaps I could crawl to him.

2038
01:33:30,278 --> 01:33:30,908
Ow Yeah!

2039
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:31,705
Call to him.

2040
01:33:32,404 --> 01:33:33,244
Pozzo!

2041
01:33:34,183 --> 01:33:35,073
Pozzo!

2042
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:36,051
Together.

2043
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:39,450
Pozzo! Pozzo!

2044
01:33:40,153 --> 01:33:42,753
We can try him with other names.

2045
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:44,006
It'd be amusing.

2046
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:45,096
What'd be amusing?

2047
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:48,039
To try him with other names,
one after the other.

2048
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:51,289
It'd pass the time. And we'd be
bound to hit on the right...

2049
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:52,683
...one sooner or later.

2050
01:33:52,684 --> 01:33:53,924
I tell you his name is Pozzo.

2051
01:33:54,106 --> 01:33:54,896
We'll soon see.

2052
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:58,719
Abel! Abel!

2053
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:00,268
Help!

2054
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:01,494
Got it in one!

2055
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,457
I begin to weary of this motif.

2056
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,830
Perhaps the other is called Cain.

2057
01:34:07,665 --> 01:34:09,305
Cain! Cain!

2058
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:10,761
Help!

2059
01:34:11,483 --> 01:34:12,603
He's all humanity.

2060
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:21,100
Look at the little cloud.

2061
01:34:21,299 --> 01:34:21,829
Where?

2062
01:34:21,834 --> 01:34:23,094
There. In the zenith.

2063
01:34:24,686 --> 01:34:26,256
Well? What is there so wonderful
about it?

2064
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:32,608
Let's pass on now to something else,
do you mind?

2065
01:34:33,155 --> 01:34:34,395
I was just going to suggest it.

2066
01:34:34,398 --> 01:34:35,658
But to what?

2067
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:40,738
Suppose we got up to begin with?

2068
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:42,131
No harm trying.

2069
01:34:47,158 --> 01:34:47,888
Child's play.

2070
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,060
Simple question of will-power.

2071
01:34:49,063 --> 01:34:49,683
And now?

2072
01:34:49,675 --> 01:34:50,875
Help!

2073
01:34:50,877 --> 01:34:51,927
- Let's go.
- We can't.

2074
01:34:51,932 --> 01:34:53,322
- Why not?
- We're waiting for Godot.

2075
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:54,330
Ah! Yes.

2076
01:34:56,198 --> 01:34:56,988
What'll we do,..

2077
01:34:58,013 --> 01:34:59,533
...what'll we do!

2078
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:01,061
Help!

2079
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:02,286
What about helping him?

2080
01:35:02,285 --> 01:35:03,545
- What does he want?
- He wants to get up.

2081
01:35:03,897 --> 01:35:05,767
- Why doesn't he?
- He wants us to help him get up.

2082
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:08,396
Why don't we? What are we waiting for?

2083
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,397
He is doing it on purpose.

2084
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:24,535
We must hold him.

2085
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:33,119
Feeling better?

2086
01:35:33,154 --> 01:35:34,304
Who are you?

2087
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:35,988
Do you not recognize us?

2088
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,840
I am blind.

2089
01:35:38,563 --> 01:35:41,743
- Blind?
- Perhaps he can see into the future.

2090
01:35:42,108 --> 01:35:44,208
Blind? Since when?

2091
01:35:44,459 --> 01:35:46,479
I used to have wonderful sight—

2092
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,670
Expand! Expand!

2093
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:49,780
Let him alone.

2094
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,179
Can't you see he's thinking of
the days when he was happy.

2095
01:35:52,776 --> 01:35:56,506
Memoria praeteritorum bonorum—

2096
01:35:57,372 --> 01:35:58,722
That must be unpleasant.

2097
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:01,110
Quite wonderful!

2098
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:02,946
I'm asking you if it came on you
all of a sudden.

2099
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:06,162
I woke up one fine day as blind
as Fortune.

2100
01:36:07,814 --> 01:36:10,324
Sometimes I wonder if I'm not
still asleep.

2101
01:36:10,662 --> 01:36:11,362
And when was that?

2102
01:36:11,787 --> 01:36:12,617
I don't know.

2103
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:13,968
But no later than yesterday—

2104
01:36:13,973 --> 01:36:15,323
Don't question me!

2105
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:18,761
The blind have no notion of time.

2106
01:36:19,864 --> 01:36:22,424
The things of time are hidden
from them too.

2107
01:36:23,077 --> 01:36:24,177
Well just fancy that!

2108
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:26,569
I could have sworn it was just
the opposite.

2109
01:36:27,812 --> 01:36:28,852
Where is my menial?

2110
01:36:29,251 --> 01:36:30,181
He's about somewhere.

2111
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:31,928
Why doesn't he answer when I call?

2112
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:32,800
I don't know.

2113
01:36:33,959 --> 01:36:35,039
He seems to be sleeping.

2114
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:36,969
Perhaps he's dead.

2115
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:39,331
- Go and see is he hurt.
- We can't leave you.

2116
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,240
You needn't both go.

2117
01:36:41,937 --> 01:36:42,607
- You go.
-Me?

2118
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:44,655
After what he did to me?
Never!

2119
01:36:44,662 --> 01:36:47,182
Yes, yes let your friend go,
he stinks so.

2120
01:36:49,661 --> 01:36:50,451
What is he waiting for?

2121
01:36:51,065 --> 01:36:51,855
What are you waiting for?

2122
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:53,197
I'm waiting for Godot.

2123
01:36:54,728 --> 01:36:55,568
What exactly should he do?

2124
01:36:56,202 --> 01:36:58,722
Well to begin with he should
pull on the rope,..

2125
01:36:59,382 --> 01:37:01,982
as hard as he likes so long as
he doesn't strangle him.

2126
01:37:02,543 --> 01:37:03,913
He usually responds to that.

2127
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:05,821
If not...

2128
01:37:06,543 --> 01:37:08,043
...he should give him a taste
of his boot,..

2129
01:37:08,807 --> 01:37:11,347
...in the face and the privates
as far as possible.

2130
01:37:11,354 --> 01:37:12,994
You see, you've nothing to be
afraid of.

2131
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,964
It's even an opportunity to
revenge yourself.

2132
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,490
And if he defends himself?

2133
01:37:16,493 --> 01:37:17,263
No no,..

2134
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,322
...he never defends himself.

2135
01:37:21,088 --> 01:37:22,408
I'll come flying to the rescue.

2136
01:37:23,303 --> 01:37:25,023
Don't take your eyes off me.

2137
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,101
Make sure he's alive before
you start.

2138
01:37:31,413 --> 01:37:33,033
No point in exerting yourself
if he's dead.

2139
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:35,860
He's breathing.

2140
01:37:36,032 --> 01:37:37,072
Then let him have it.

2141
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,420
The brute!

2142
01:37:45,882 --> 01:37:46,762
What's gone wrong now?

2143
01:37:48,413 --> 01:37:49,413
My friend has hurt himself.

2144
01:37:49,692 --> 01:37:51,332
- And Lucky?
- So it is he?

2145
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:52,765
- What?
- It is Lucky?

2146
01:37:53,262 --> 01:37:54,082
I don't understand.

2147
01:37:54,447 --> 01:37:55,257
And you are Pozzo?

2148
01:37:55,557 --> 01:37:56,347
Certainly...

2149
01:37:56,953 --> 01:37:57,913
...I am Pozzo.

2150
01:37:58,147 --> 01:37:59,267
The same as yesterday?

2151
01:38:00,139 --> 01:38:01,039
Yesterday?

2152
01:38:01,634 --> 01:38:02,494
We met yesterday.

2153
01:38:03,268 --> 01:38:04,338
Do you not remember?

2154
01:38:04,969 --> 01:38:08,339
I don't remember having met anyone
yesterday.

2155
01:38:09,905 --> 01:38:13,135
But tomorrow I won't remember
having met anyone today.

2156
01:38:13,626 --> 01:38:15,376
So don't count on me to enlighten you.

2157
01:38:15,731 --> 01:38:15,971
But—

2158
01:38:16,002 --> 01:38:16,592
Enough!

2159
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:18,499
Up pig!

2160
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,282
You were bringing him to the fair
to sell him.

2161
01:38:20,846 --> 01:38:21,646
You spoke to us.

2162
01:38:22,416 --> 01:38:23,186
He danced.

2163
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,620
He thought.

2164
01:38:25,086 --> 01:38:26,276
You had your sight.

2165
01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:28,822
As you please.

2166
01:38:30,003 --> 01:38:30,973
Let me go!

2167
01:38:32,325 --> 01:38:33,375
Up!

2168
01:38:39,186 --> 01:38:40,206
He is getting up!

2169
01:38:41,187 --> 01:38:42,097
It better.

2170
01:38:53,637 --> 01:38:54,937
He is picking up bags.

2171
01:39:03,466 --> 01:39:05,666
Now is all said.

2172
01:39:06,737 --> 01:39:07,377
Whip!

2173
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:08,420
Where do you go from here?

2174
01:39:09,848 --> 01:39:11,278
None of my business.

2175
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:13,928
How changed you are?

2176
01:39:14,509 --> 01:39:15,229
Whip!

2177
01:39:34,436 --> 01:39:35,376
Rope!

2178
01:39:50,129 --> 01:39:50,979
What is there in the bag?

2179
01:39:52,204 --> 01:39:53,384
Sand.

2180
01:39:55,604 --> 01:39:56,684
On!

2181
01:39:58,714 --> 01:39:59,494
Don't go yet.

2182
01:39:59,889 --> 01:40:00,659
I'm going.

2183
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,340
What do you do when you fall
far from help?

2184
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:06,962
We wait till we can get up.

2185
01:40:08,066 --> 01:40:09,376
Then we go on.

2186
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:12,850
On!

2187
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:14,359
Before you go...

2188
01:40:15,226 --> 01:40:16,026
...tell him to sing.

2189
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:17,983
- Who?
- Lucky.

2190
01:40:18,502 --> 01:40:19,842
- To sing?
- Yes

2191
01:40:19,837 --> 01:40:20,727
Or to think.

2192
01:40:21,881 --> 01:40:22,911
Or to recite.

2193
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:24,721
But he is dumb.

2194
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:26,039
Dumb!

2195
01:40:26,703 --> 01:40:29,413
Dumb. He can't even groan.

2196
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:31,170
Dumb!

2197
01:40:32,036 --> 01:40:32,846
Since when?

2198
01:40:33,493 --> 01:40:37,293
Have you not done tormenting me
with your accursed time!

2199
01:40:38,301 --> 01:40:39,341
It's abominable!

2200
01:40:40,477 --> 01:40:41,267
When!

2201
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:43,071
When!

2202
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:47,452
One day, is that not enough for you,..

2203
01:40:48,249 --> 01:40:53,389
...one day any like other day
one day he went dumb,..

2204
01:40:54,384 --> 01:40:56,454
one day I went blind,

2205
01:40:57,384 --> 01:41:03,894
one day we'll go deaf, one day
we were born, one day we shall die,..

2206
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:06,470
the same day,..

2207
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,090
the same second,

2208
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,490
is that not enough for you?

2209
01:41:16,985 --> 01:41:22,185
They give birth astride of a grave,..

2210
01:41:23,153 --> 01:41:26,593
...the light gleams an instant,..

2211
01:41:31,383 --> 01:41:33,783
...then it's night once more.

2212
01:41:40,355 --> 01:41:41,505
On!

2213
01:42:12,154 --> 01:42:15,164
Why will you never let me sleep?

2214
01:42:15,655 --> 01:42:17,155
I felt lonely.

2215
01:42:17,155 --> 01:42:18,155
I was dreaming I was happy.

2216
01:42:19,655 --> 01:42:21,155
That passed the time.

2217
01:42:21,156 --> 01:42:23,156
- I was dreaming that—
- Don't tell me!

2218
01:42:26,157 --> 01:42:28,157
I wonder is he really blind.

2219
01:42:28,157 --> 01:42:28,657
Blind?

2220
01:42:29,157 --> 01:42:29,657
Who?

2221
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:33,558
What want truly blind say had
no notion of time.

2222
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,210
But who?

2223
01:42:34,491 --> 01:42:35,341
Pozzo.

2224
01:42:35,513 --> 01:42:36,273
Is he blind?

2225
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,350
So he said.

2226
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:38,931
You dreamt it.

2227
01:42:39,317 --> 01:42:40,977
It seemed to me he saw us.

2228
01:42:43,735 --> 01:42:44,525
Let’s go.

2229
01:42:45,098 --> 01:42:45,648
We can’t.

2230
01:42:45,918 --> 01:42:46,648
Ah! Yes.

2231
01:42:48,301 --> 01:42:49,371
Are you sure it wasn't him?

2232
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:50,960
- Who?
- Godot.

2233
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:52,500
- But who?
- Pozzo.

2234
01:42:53,317 --> 01:42:54,197
Not at all!

2235
01:42:59,556 --> 01:43:00,436
Not at all!

2236
01:43:05,747 --> 01:43:06,787
Not at all!

2237
01:43:06,793 --> 01:43:08,373
I suppose I might as well get up.

2238
01:43:12,932 --> 01:43:14,382
I don't know what to think any more.

2239
01:43:14,384 --> 01:43:15,534
Didi my feet!

2240
01:43:16,576 --> 01:43:17,426
Help me!

2241
01:43:24,861 --> 01:43:26,181
Was I sleeping,..

2242
01:43:27,024 --> 01:43:28,674
...while the others suffered?

2243
01:43:30,138 --> 01:43:31,348
Am I sleeping now?

2244
01:43:33,803 --> 01:43:34,973
Tomorrow, when I wake,..

2245
01:43:35,992 --> 01:43:36,902
...or think I do.

2246
01:43:37,763 --> 01:43:39,143
What shall I say of today?

2247
01:43:41,377 --> 01:43:44,187
That with Estragon my friend,
at this place, until the fall of night,

2248
01:43:44,185 --> 01:43:45,445
I waited for Godot?

2249
01:43:47,386 --> 01:43:49,896
That Pozzo passed, with his carrier,
and that he spoke to us?

2250
01:43:51,869 --> 01:43:52,529
Probably.

2251
01:43:54,085 --> 01:43:56,245
But in all that what truth will
there be?

2252
01:43:58,972 --> 01:44:00,062
He'll know nothing.

2253
01:44:01,023 --> 01:44:03,973
He'll tell me about the blows
he received and I'll give him a carrot.

2254
01:44:06,825 --> 01:44:09,385
Astride of a grave and a difficult
birth.

2255
01:44:10,893 --> 01:44:15,073
Down in the hole, lingeringly,
the grave digger puts on the forceps.

2256
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:18,448
We have time to grow old.

2257
01:44:19,818 --> 01:44:21,558
The air is full of our cries.

2258
01:44:25,222 --> 01:44:28,512
But habit is a great deadener.

2259
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:33,910
At me too someone is looking,..

2260
01:44:35,487 --> 01:44:38,087
...of me too someone is saying,..
He is sleeping,..

2261
01:44:38,859 --> 01:44:41,879
...he knows nothing, let him sleep on.

2262
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:49,810
I can't go on!

2263
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:56,290
What have I said?

2264
01:45:00,976 --> 01:45:01,696
Mister...

2265
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:07,414
Mister Albert...

2266
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:09,798
Off we go again.

2267
01:45:25,033 --> 01:45:26,393
Do you not recognize me?

2268
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:27,747
No Sir.

2269
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,470
It wasn't you came yesterday.

2270
01:45:30,983 --> 01:45:31,843
No Sir.

2271
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:34,081
This is your first time.

2272
01:45:34,769 --> 01:45:35,779
Yes Sir.

2273
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,320
You have a message from Mr. Godot.

2274
01:45:45,842 --> 01:45:46,722
Yes Sir.

2275
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:48,378
He won't come this evening.

2276
01:45:49,115 --> 01:45:49,925
No Sir.

2277
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:52,274
But he'll come tomorrow.

2278
01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:53,463
Yes Sir.

2279
01:45:53,924 --> 01:45:55,324
Without fail.

2280
01:45:55,832 --> 01:45:56,532
Yes Sir.

2281
01:46:03,743 --> 01:46:05,183
Did you meet anyone?

2282
01:46:06,113 --> 01:46:07,093
No, Sir.

2283
01:46:07,915 --> 01:46:08,985
Two other...

2284
01:46:09,369 --> 01:46:10,109
...men?

2285
01:46:10,533 --> 01:46:12,413
I didn't see anyone, Sir.

2286
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:21,934
What does he do,..

2287
01:46:22,768 --> 01:46:23,818
...Mr. Godot?

2288
01:46:26,022 --> 01:46:26,662
Do you hear me?

2289
01:46:27,106 --> 01:46:27,896
Yes Sir.

2290
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:29,332
Well?

2291
01:46:30,612 --> 01:46:33,102
He does nothing, Sir.

2292
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:35,742
How is your brother?

2293
01:46:36,287 --> 01:46:37,127
He's sick, Sir.

2294
01:46:38,243 --> 01:46:39,973
Perhaps it was he came yesterday.

2295
01:46:40,514 --> 01:46:41,564
I don't know, Sir.

2296
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:51,688
Has he a beard, Mr. Godot?

2297
01:46:52,515 --> 01:46:53,455
Yes Sir.

2298
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,230
Fair... or black?

2299
01:46:56,604 --> 01:46:57,514
Or...

2300
01:46:58,624 --> 01:46:59,384
Or red?

2301
01:46:59,906 --> 01:47:01,186
I think it's white, Sir.

2302
01:47:02,606 --> 01:47:04,276
Christ have mercy on us!

2303
01:47:07,523 --> 01:47:09,383
What am I to tell Mr. Godot, Sir?

2304
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:11,939
Tell him...

2305
01:47:14,581 --> 01:47:16,631
tell him you saw me and that...

2306
01:47:19,364 --> 01:47:20,414
...that you saw me.

2307
01:47:22,726 --> 01:47:24,146
You're sure you saw me,..

2308
01:47:25,566 --> 01:47:28,446
...you won't come and tell me
tomorrow that you never saw me!

2309
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,630
What's wrong with you?

2310
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,020
Nothing.

2311
01:48:50,889 --> 01:48:51,599
I'm going.

2312
01:48:51,777 --> 01:48:52,597
So am I.

2313
01:48:55,541 --> 01:48:57,031
Was I long asleep?

2314
01:48:57,536 --> 01:48:58,476
I don't know.

2315
01:49:00,055 --> 01:49:00,975
Where shall we go?

2316
01:49:01,957 --> 01:49:02,597
Not far.

2317
01:49:02,596 --> 01:49:05,556
Oh yes, let's go far away from here.

2318
01:49:05,882 --> 01:49:06,552
We can't.

2319
01:49:06,738 --> 01:49:07,268
Why not?

2320
01:49:07,618 --> 01:49:08,748
We have to come back tomorrow.

2321
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:09,370
What for?

2322
01:49:09,635 --> 01:49:10,565
To wait for Godot.

2323
01:49:11,632 --> 01:49:12,652
Ah Yes!

2324
01:49:14,187 --> 01:49:14,807
He didn't come?

2325
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:15,960
No.

2326
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,156
And now it's too late.

2327
01:49:18,338 --> 01:49:19,188
Yes,..

2328
01:49:19,723 --> 01:49:20,803
now it's night.

2329
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:25,780
And if we dropped him?

2330
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,590
If we dropped him?

2331
01:49:31,423 --> 01:49:32,293
He'd punish us.

2332
01:49:37,073 --> 01:49:38,873
Everything's dead but the tree.

2333
01:49:40,572 --> 01:49:41,512
What is it?

2334
01:49:41,509 --> 01:49:42,519
It's the tree.

2335
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:43,771
But what kind?

2336
01:49:44,174 --> 01:49:45,014
I don't know.

2337
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:46,041
A willow.

2338
01:49:49,428 --> 01:49:50,268
Let’s go.

2339
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:05,347
Why don't we hang ourselves?

2340
01:50:06,082 --> 01:50:06,582
With what?

2341
01:50:07,031 --> 01:50:08,161
You haven't got a bit of rope?

2342
01:50:08,516 --> 01:50:09,066
No.

2343
01:50:10,006 --> 01:50:10,676
Then we can't.

2344
01:50:11,433 --> 01:50:12,063
Let's go.

2345
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,214
Wait, there's my belt.

2346
01:50:14,687 --> 01:50:15,427
It's too short.

2347
01:50:15,783 --> 01:50:17,483
You could hang onto my legs.

2348
01:50:17,863 --> 01:50:18,863
And who'd hang onto mine?

2349
01:50:19,864 --> 01:50:20,574
True.

2350
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:21,938
Show me all the same.

2351
01:50:26,557 --> 01:50:27,587
It might do in a pinch.

2352
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:28,980
But is it strong enough?

2353
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:29,908
We'll soon see.

2354
01:50:33,652 --> 01:50:34,832
Not worth a curse.

2355
01:50:37,289 --> 01:50:38,649
You say we have to come back tomorrow?

2356
01:50:39,065 --> 01:50:39,575
Yes.

2357
01:50:40,017 --> 01:50:42,577
Then we can bring a good bit of rope.

2358
01:50:43,251 --> 01:50:43,951
Yes.

2359
01:50:45,698 --> 01:50:46,238
Didi?

2360
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:47,496
Yes.

2361
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:49,591
I can't go on like this.

2362
01:50:50,392 --> 01:50:51,192
That's what you think.

2363
01:50:51,987 --> 01:50:54,757
If we parted? That might be better
for us.

2364
01:50:55,872 --> 01:50:57,062
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.

2365
01:50:59,101 --> 01:51:00,281
Unless Godot comes.

2366
01:51:00,949 --> 01:51:01,829
And if he comes?

2367
01:51:02,528 --> 01:51:03,568
We'll be saved.

2368
01:51:06,396 --> 01:51:07,096
Well?

2369
01:51:08,142 --> 01:51:09,102
Shall we go?

2370
01:51:09,608 --> 01:51:10,638
Pull on your trousers.

2371
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:12,550
- What?
- Pull on your trousers.

2372
01:51:13,602 --> 01:51:15,072
You want me to pull off my trousers?

2373
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:17,450
Pull ON your trousers.

2374
01:51:18,117 --> 01:51:19,477
Ah Yes!

2375
01:51:28,949 --> 01:51:29,619
Well?

2376
01:51:31,847 --> 01:51:32,577
Shall we go?

2377
01:51:33,154 --> 01:51:34,044
Yes.

2378
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:36,491
Let's go.
